A person is found to have incurred a relevant penalty when the amount of the penalty they must pay is decided.</p><p>In broad terms, the amount of a relevant penalty depends on:</p><ul><li>the person’s inaccuracy, failure, omission or wrongdoing being deliberate</li><li>the amount of the PLR, and</li><li>the quality of disclosure.</li></ul><p>The relevant penalty is found when all of those things are known.</p><p>They become known when the person and HMRC agree them or when a tribunal or court makes a decision that is not, or cannot be, challenged, see CH190940.</p><h3 id="example">Example</h3><p>HMRC undertakes an investigation into Ewan’s tax affairs and discovers two deliberate defaults.
