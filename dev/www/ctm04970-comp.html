Technically, in-year relief for NTLRDs arising before 1 April 2017 is claimed under CTA09/S461, whereas in-year relief for NTLRDs arising from that date is claimed under CTA09/S463B. The company can therefore choose to treat the NTLRDs arising as apportioned to the pre- and post-1 April 2017 periods for purposes beyond calculating the effects of the loss reform, and could, for example, treat them as carried forward from the deemed period to 31 March 2017 into the deemed period beginning 1 April 2017.</p><p>In this case, the company does not make this choice. An example of a company that does choose the alternative treatment is available at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/company-taxation-manual/ctm04920">CTM04920</a>.</p><p>This alternative treatment is only available for NTLRDs, due to the introduction of <ins>CTA09/PART5/CHAPTER16A</ins> <del>CTA09/PART5/CH16A</del> for periods from 1 April 2017.</p><h4 id="step-3">Step 3</h4><p>Calculate the relevant maximum for the second notional period, in accordance with the loss restriction.</p><table><thead><tr><th>1/4/17 to 31/12/17</th><th>£</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Modified total profits <ins>(CTA10/S269ZF (3)</ins> <del>(CTA10/S269ZF(3)</del> step 1)</td><td>2,475,000</td></tr><tr><td>Less amounts deducted from total profits (excluding brought forward property losses) <ins>(S269ZF (3)</ins> <del>(S269ZF(3)</del> steps 2 and 4):</td><td/></tr><tr><td>NTLRDs arising</td><td>(1,125,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Qualifying trading profits <ins>(S269ZF (3)</ins> <del>(S269ZF(3)</del> step 5)</td><td>1,350,000</td></tr><tr><td>Relevant trading profits and relevant profits <ins>(S269ZF (1) and S269ZD (5))</ins> <del>(s269ZF(1) and s269ZFA)</del> </td><td/></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td>(assume no deductions allowance)</td><td>1,350,000</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>Relevant maximum <ins>(S269ZD (4))</ins> <del>(S269ZD(4))</del> </td><td>675,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The relevant maximum gives the total amount of profits that can be relieved using losses brought forward, with the exception of losses such as allowable capital losses that are outside the scope of the loss restriction.</p><p>There is no need to calculate trade and non-trade relevant maxima <ins>(CTA10/S269ZB (5), S269ZC (3))</ins> <del>(CTA10/S269ZB(5), S269ZC(3))</del> since all of the company’s losses brought forward are available for relief against total profits. </p><h4 id="step-4">Step 4</h4><p>Calculate the net result for the second notional period.</p><table><thead><tr><th>1/4/17 to 31/12/17</th><th>£</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Property business profits</td><td>2,475,000</td></tr><tr><td>Less NTLRDs arising</td><td>(1,125,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Less property business loss brought forward</td><td>(675,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Net profits</td><td>675,000</td></tr><tr><td>Remaining property business loss brought forward, carried forward to the accounting period beginning 1 January 2018</td><td>(2,325,000)</td></tr></tbody></table><p/><h4 id="step-5">Step 5</h4><p>Compute the profits chargeable to Corporation Tax for the straddling accounting period.</p><table><thead><tr><th>1/1/17 to 31/12/17</th><th>£</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Property business profits</td><td>3,300,000</td></tr><tr><td>NTLRDs arising</td><td>(1,950,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Property business loss brought forward</td><td>(675,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Profits chargeable to Corporation Tax</td><td>675,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The following amounts are carried forward to the period commencing 1 January 2018.
