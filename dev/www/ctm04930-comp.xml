This is because those provisions are relevant only for the purposes of applying <ins>F(2)A17/SCH4.</ins> <del>Schedule 4.</del> </p><p>This may occur because:</p><ul><li>There is no loss carried-forward at the beginning of the period, or</li><li>Any loss carried-forward cannot be set against the profits of the straddling period.</li></ul><h3 id="example">Example</h3><p>In its accounting period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017, Company C has:</p><ul><li>£1,000,000 trade losses carried-forward under CTA10/S45 from previous accounting periods,</li><li>£100,000 trade losses incurred in the accounting period,</li><li>£500,000 property business profits, and</li><li>No non-trading profits.</li></ul><p>The company sets the £100,000 losses of the period against its property business profits, leaving a net profit of £400,000.</p><p>The company does not have any losses of the period remaining to carry forward to subsequent accounting periods, so there is no reason to apportion amounts for this purpose.</p><p>The company cannot use its carried-forward trading losses in this period because it has no trading profits to set them against. It has no other losses carried-forward from previous periods, so there is no need to calculate the loss restriction or apportion amounts for this purpose.</p><p>The unused trade losses carried-forward from previous periods are carried-forward once again to the accounting period immediately following the straddling period as pre-1 April 2017 trade losses, under <ins>CTA10/S45.</ins> <del>s45.</del> </p></div></div><div class="subsection-collection"/><nav class="gem-c-pagination" role="navigation" aria-label="Pagination"><ul class="gem-c-pagination__list" data-module="track-click"><li class="gem-c-pagination__item gem-c-pagination__item--previous"><a href="/hmrc-internal-manuals/company-taxation-manual/ctm04920" class="gem-c-pagination__link" rel="prev" data-track-category="contentsClicked" data-track-action="previous" data-track-label="/hmrc-internal-manuals/company-taxation-manual/ctm04920" data-track-dimension="previous" data-track-dimension-index="29"><span class="gem-c-pagination__link-title">{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}path&gt;{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}svg&gt;<span class="gem-c-pagination__link-text">Previous page </span></span></a></li><li class="gem-c-pagination__item gem-c-pagination__item--next"><a href="/hmrc-internal-manuals/company-taxation-manual/ctm04940" class="gem-c-pagination__link" rel="next" data-track-category="contentsClicked" data-track-action="next" data-track-label="/hmrc-internal-manuals/company-taxation-manual/ctm04940" data-track-dimension="next" data-track-dimension-index="29"><span class="gem-c-pagination__link-title">{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}path&gt;{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}svg&gt;<span class="gem-c-pagination__link-text">Next page </span></span></a></li></ul></nav></article></div></data>
