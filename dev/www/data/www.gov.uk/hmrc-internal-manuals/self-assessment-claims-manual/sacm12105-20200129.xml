You may need to refer, among other things, to our published guidance, advice from HMRC technical specialists, reported cases and external comment as evidence of a practice generally prevailing.</p><p>A practice need not have been universally followed. But where a tribunal or court decides that a practice is wrong you should take it to have ceased to be a generally prevailing practice at that point even if the decision is subject to appeal.</p><h2 id="tax-paid-contrary-to-eu-law">Tax paid contrary to EU law</h2><p>Case G and H do not apply if tax has been paid contrary to EU law.</p><p>(This content has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)</p><h3 id="para-28-and-9-schedule-1ab-tma-1970">Para 2(8) and (9) Schedule 1AB TMA 1970</h3><h3 id="para-51a8-schedule-18-fa-1998">Para 51A(8) Schedule 18 FA 1998</h3><p/></div></div><div class="subsection-collection"/><nav class="gem-c-pagination" role="navigation" aria-label="Pagination"><ul class="gem-c-pagination__list" data-module="track-click"><li class="gem-c-pagination__item gem-c-pagination__item--previous"><a href="/hmrc-internal-manuals/self-assessment-claims-manual/sacm12100" class="gem-c-pagination__link" rel="prev" data-track-category="contentsClicked" data-track-action="previous" data-track-label="/hmrc-internal-manuals/self-assessment-claims-manual/sacm12100" data-track-dimension="previous" data-track-dimension-index="29"><span class="gem-c-pagination__link-title">{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}path&gt;{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}svg&gt;<span class="gem-c-pagination__link-text">Previous page </span></span></a></li></ul></nav></article></div></data>
