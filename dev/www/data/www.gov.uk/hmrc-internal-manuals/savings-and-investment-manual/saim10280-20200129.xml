Such interest is a liability of the individual and not of the partnership and therefore is not allowable as an expense in computing the firm’s profits.</p><p>The relief covers loans to</p><ul><li>buy a share in a partnership,</li><li>contribute money to the partnership by way of capital or premium, <ins>which is used for the purposes of a trade or profession carried on by the partnership,</ins> </li><li>advance money to <ins>the partnership, which is used for the purposes of a trade or profession carried on by</ins> the partnership,</li><li>repay another eligible loan to a partnership.</li></ul><p>Relief will be due to both a new partner who ‘buys in’ to an existing firm by purchasing the share of an outgoing <del>partner, or by contributing capital in return for being admitted as a</del> partner, and to an existing partner who increases his or her share by ‘buying out’, wholly or in part, the shares of others.</p><h3 id="buying-a-share-in-a-partnership">Buying a share in a partnership</h3><p>‘Share’ implies that the claimant must be a partner but there are no conditions about the extent of his interest in the capital or profits of the partnership. <ins>It is only possible to buy something that exists, and as a partnership or LLP cannot create and sell shares in itself, in this context the ‘share’ is the interest in the partnership or LLP being acquired from an existing partner.</ins> <del>A subscription for capital in a Limited Liability Partnership is also acceptable.</del> </p><h3 id="contributing-money-to-a-partnership-by-way-of-capital-or-a-premium">Contributing money to a partnership by way of capital or a premium</h3><p>A capital contribution will ordinarily be credited to the individual’s capital account in the partnership balance sheet. A premium is a sum contributed over and above the amount credited to the contributor’s capital account and may be retained by the other partners personally.</p><p>To qualify, the money must be used wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the partnership <ins>trade or profession.</ins> <del>business.</del> A premium retained by the other partners personally may fail to satisfy this <ins>condition.</ins> <del>condition, but in most cases would qualify as buying a share in the partnership.</del> </p><h3 id="advancing-money-to-a-partnership">Advancing money to a partnership</h3><p>The money must be used wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the partnership’s <ins>trade or profession.</ins> <del>business.</del> </p><h3 id="repaying-another-eligible-loan">Repaying another eligible loan</h3><p>Relief is due if the interest on the original loan would have been eligible for relief had that loan continued. In such a case the loans are treated as if they were one loan (ITA07/S408).</p></div></div><div class="subsection-collection"/><nav class="gem-c-pagination" role="navigation" aria-label="Pagination"><ul class="gem-c-pagination__list" data-module="track-click"><li class="gem-c-pagination__item gem-c-pagination__item--previous"><a href="/hmrc-internal-manuals/savings-and-investment-manual/saim10270" class="gem-c-pagination__link" rel="prev" data-track-category="contentsClicked" data-track-action="previous" data-track-label="/hmrc-internal-manuals/savings-and-investment-manual/saim10270" data-track-dimension="previous" data-track-dimension-index="29"><span class="gem-c-pagination__link-title">{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}path&gt;{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}svg&gt;<span class="gem-c-pagination__link-text">Previous page </span></span></a></li><li class="gem-c-pagination__item gem-c-pagination__item--next"><a href="/hmrc-internal-manuals/savings-and-investment-manual/saim10290" class="gem-c-pagination__link" rel="next" data-track-category="contentsClicked" data-track-action="next" data-track-label="/hmrc-internal-manuals/savings-and-investment-manual/saim10290" data-track-dimension="next" data-track-dimension-index="29"><span class="gem-c-pagination__link-title">{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}path&gt;{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}svg&gt;<span class="gem-c-pagination__link-text">Next page </span></span></a></li></ul></nav></article></div></data>
