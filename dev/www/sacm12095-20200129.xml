The enquiry established that her accounts deductions were overstated in respect of premises costs. The enquiry was formally settled for additional tax, interest and a penalty. Neither the closure notice nor the amendment to Mrs Y’s self-assessment on closure of the enquiry was appealed. One year later Mrs Y claimed overpayment relief for further premises costs. This was an issue that could have been dealt with by an appeal against the enquiry conclusions. Her overpayment relief claim was refused under Case E as she ought reasonably to have known that she should have dealt with any further deductions due in respect of premises costs by appealing the enquiry conclusion.</p><p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/self-assessment-claims-manual/sacm12085">SACM12085</a> for guidance on what a person ought reasonably to have known. An appellant is expected to consider and put forward all the grounds of appeal that they might rely on.</p><p>See ARTG2240 if the person wishes to make a late appeal.</p><p>(This content has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)</p><h3 id="para-26-schedule-1ab-tma-1970">Para 2(6) Schedule 1AB TMA 1970</h3><h3 id="para-51a6-schedule-18-fa-1998">Para 51A(6) Schedule 18 FA 1998</h3></div></div><div class="subsection-collection"/><nav class="gem-c-pagination" role="navigation" aria-label="Pagination"><ul class="gem-c-pagination__list" data-module="track-click"><li class="gem-c-pagination__item gem-c-pagination__item--previous"><a href="/hmrc-internal-manuals/self-assessment-claims-manual/sacm12090" class="gem-c-pagination__link" rel="prev" data-track-category="contentsClicked" data-track-action="previous" data-track-label="/hmrc-internal-manuals/self-assessment-claims-manual/sacm12090" data-track-dimension="previous" data-track-dimension-index="29"><span class="gem-c-pagination__link-title">{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}path&gt;{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}svg&gt;<span class="gem-c-pagination__link-text">Previous page </span></span></a></li><li class="gem-c-pagination__item gem-c-pagination__item--next"><a href="/hmrc-internal-manuals/self-assessment-claims-manual/sacm12100" class="gem-c-pagination__link" rel="next" data-track-category="contentsClicked" data-track-action="next" data-track-label="/hmrc-internal-manuals/self-assessment-claims-manual/sacm12100" data-track-dimension="next" data-track-dimension-index="29"><span class="gem-c-pagination__link-title">{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}path&gt;{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}svg&gt;<span class="gem-c-pagination__link-text">Next page </span></span></a></li></ul></nav></article></div></data>
