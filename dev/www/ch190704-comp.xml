The definition of a relevant penalty is at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/compliance-handbook/ch190644">CH190644</a>.</p><p>If a person has earned the maximum quality of disclosure reduction for a relevant penalty, the penalty is not a qualifying relevant penalty and we cannot publish details of the penalty.</p><p>In considering whether a person has earned the maximum penalty reduction you may also have to consider the type of disclosure and the timing of the disclosure.</p><h2 id="the-type-of-disclosure">The type of disclosure</h2><p>For cases that do not involve offshore matters or offshore transfers, it does not matter whether the person’s disclosure is unprompted or prompted. However, where an inaccuracy or failure involves an offshore matter or an offshore transfer, the taxpayer must have made an unprompted disclosure, as well as earning the maximum reduction, for the penalty not to be a qualifying relevant penalty. So the answer to the fourth question will always be ‘Yes’ in any offshore penalty case where the disclosure was prompted.</p><h2 id="the-timing-of-the-disclosure">The timing of the disclosure</h2><p>Where quality of disclosure has been restricted only because of a delay in starting to disclose, you should treat the maximum reduction as having been earned, for the purposes of this question. In other words, where a restriction of 10% is applied under CH73360 (Sch 41) or CH82465 (Sch 24) but otherwise the maximum 100% is given for ‘Telling, Helping and Giving Access’, publication should not take place (unless the disclosure was prompted and relates to an offshore matter or transfer). </p><p>This means that the operation of the ‘10% restriction rule’ will not by itself lead to publication.</p><p>If a person has not earned the maximum reduction of a relevant penalty for the quality of disclosure for any other reason, or if they have made a prompted disclosure in an offshore penalty case, you should go on to consider question 5, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/compliance-handbook/ch190720">CH190720</a>.</p><p>The guidance below looks at two possible situations and the general topic of disclosure.</p><h3 id="one-relevant-penalty-from-the-investigation">One relevant penalty from the investigation</h3><p>Here there is only one penalty to consider. Has the maximum reduction for quality of disclosure been given? In such a case, it will be straightforward to see whether</p><ul><li>the maximum reduction has been given, and so we cannot publish details, or</li><li>the maximum reduction has not been given, and so we go on to consider question 5, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/compliance-handbook/ch190720">CH190720</a>.</li></ul><h3 id="more-than-one-relevant-penalty-from-the-investigation">More than one relevant penalty from the investigation</h3><p>Here each relevant penalty needs to be considered.
