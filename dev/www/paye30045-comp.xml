The old employer remains responsible for any tax due on payments he makes, but the new employer completes the end of year returns for the whole year.</p><p>A succession can only take place if the old and new employers agree to it. If the old employer issues forms P45 and closes down the existing PAYE scheme, then HMRC must open a new scheme for the new employer. Likewise, if the new owner continues an existing business but does not want to assume responsibility for the period up to the date of the change then no succession has taken place.</p><p>It is quite easy to mistake a change in circumstances as a succession, but an employer succession arises only where</p><ul><li>The ownership of a business changes from one legal entity to another<br/> And</li><li>The new owner takes responsibility for the pay records of the old employer</li></ul><p>Both conditions must be satisfied before it is considered that an employer succession has taken place and you must confirm this.</p><p>Note: You cannot succeed an employer record on the same day that the employer record was set up.</p><p><a href="#Top">Top of page</a></p><h2 id="IDAC5BRH">The new owner</h2><p>The new owner must be a different legal entity from the old employer.

The limited company continues under the existing PAYE scheme.</p><p><a href="#Top">Top of page</a></p><h2 id="IDAIECRH">Construction industry schemes</h2><p>There is no provision in the Regulations, to allow successions to apply to contractors.</p><p>If a contractor’s business changes hands, the old owner is treated as a cessation. The ceasing contractor must pay over the amounts deducted from payments made to subcontractors up to the date of the change and complete a monthly return for this period.</p><p>The new owner is treated as a completely new employer. You will need to set up a new employer record.

As the LLP is a separate legal entity, then as long as the LLP is agreeable to taking over the pay records of the old employer a succession has taken place.</p><p>If a limited company is succeeded by an LLP and the directors of the company will be partners in the LLP, then the company should issue forms P45 to the directors. The directors will no longer be office holders in the limited company and will be taxed on a self employed basis.</p><p>If you are notified of the creation of a LLP and need to set up a new employer record you should follow the guidance in Action Guide ‘Limited liability partnerships’ at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/paye-manual/paye21141">PAYE21141</a>.</p><p><a href="#Top">Top of page</a></p><h2 id="IDAYFCRH">Successions in RTI</h2><p>From 6 April 2013 it is important to take the action on EBS as near to the date the succession legally took place as possible.
