Compensation for such discrimination may be paid under several different heads, such as for loss of earnings, personal injury, injury to feelings and so on. Each head needs to be considered separately.</p><p>Such payments are taxable only under Section 401 ITEPA 2003. Further, they are only taxable where they are “connected” (see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim13012">EIM13012</a>) with the termination (or, less commonly, with a change in duties or earnings) of the employment. If the settlement does not specify what part of the payment is so “connected”, the facts must be analysed with care and part apportioned, if necessary, on a just and reasonable basis.</p><p>Any part of the settlement that can reasonably be attributed to discrimination occurring before the termination should be accepted as not being employment income as it is not “connected” with the termination. However, where the compensation relates only to the consequences of the termination itself, no apportionment will be appropriate. For example, if the compensation is for loss of future earnings (after termination) it is all connected with the termination and Section 401 ITEPA 2003 applies even though the discrimination brought about the termination. If, by contrast, the compensation is for injury to feelings and there was discrimination before termination, then any part of that compensation that is not connected with the termination will not be within Section 401 ITEPA 2003.</p><p>The Special Commissioners’ Decision in Walker v Adams (SpC344) may be cited in this context. It confirmed that Section 401 applies to statutory discrimination compensation, in this case for loss of earnings resulting from termination after religious discrimination. The statement that a payment made as compensation for hurt feelings was not taxable was based on the Commissioners’ view that all discrimination took place pre-termination, and was accepted by HMRC on that basis only.</p><p>An example of compensation for discrimination that falls wholly within Section 401 ITEPA 2003 is that paid as compensation for sexual discrimination to members of the armed forces who were once dismissed on becoming pregnant. In that case, the whole payment is “connected” only to the discrimination suffered in respect of the termination itself and not to any earlier act or event.</p><p>An example of compensation for discrimination that falls only partly within Section 401 ITEPA 2003 is that paid as compensation for sexual discrimination occurring over a period leading up to termination and also inherent in the termination itself. To establish the part within Section 401 ITEPA 2003, the facts need to be examined and a reasonable apportionment agreed.

This is the case even where discrimination has led to the termination of the employment, or where the termination itself was discriminatory; there is the necessary connection to the termination for s401 to apply.</p><p>On the other hand, if the payment is for a “historic” loss - as in the previous example involving gender discrimination and unequal pay - then there is no connection to the termination of employment and s401 will not apply (but s62 might).</p><h3 id="application-of-s401-itepa-2003-injury">Application of s401 ITEPA 2003: injury</h3><p>The employer may be required to pay compensation if its actions have caused a mental health condition such as stress, anxiety or depression that affects the individual’s ability to work.</p><p>Such compensation is connected to the termination of the employment because it arises from the end of the employment (and the inability to take up similar employment elsewhere). It is therefore within the scope of s401, but may qualify for the exemption for payments made in respect of injury to or disability at s406(1)(b) ITEPA 2003.</p><p>Compensation for injury should be handled in the normal way (see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim13610">EIM13610</a> onwards).

This is known as compensation for injury to feelings.</p><p>If this element of the payment can reasonably be attributed solely to discrimination occurring before the termination of employment, it should be accepted as not connected with the termination and outside of the scope of s401.</p><p>The Special Commissioners’ decision in Walker v Adams (SpC344) illustrates this. An individual accepted £77,446 as compensation after suffering constructive dismissal based on religious discrimination. This comprised £12,500 for injury to feelings and £64,947 in respect of loss of earnings. The £64,947 element was taxable under s148 ICTA 1988 (now s401 ITEPA 2003) because it was connected to the termination of the individual’s employment. HMRC accepted that the £12,500 was not taxable on the basis that the Commissioners had found that all discrimination took place pre-termination.</p><p>In other circumstances, a payment for injury to feelings may be sufficiently connected to the termination to come within the scope of s401. Taxpayers may cite the case of Oti-Obihara v HMRC (2011 TC 00819) in which the First-Tier Tribunal found that s401 does not apply to compensation for non-financial losses. However, the Court of Appeal in Moorthy v HMRC (2018 EWCA Civ 847) indicated that the ‘Oti-Obihara’ case was wrongly decided by reference to an incorrect statutory test and should not be followed.</p><p>In Moorthy v HMRC, the termination itself was discriminatory (and there had been no previous discrimination during the employment) so all of the compensation fell within s401 (despite being within the scope of s401, the amount that could be attributed to injury to feelings was exempted under provisions which have now been amended).</p><p>Where the termination is discriminatory but there has also been discrimination during the employment, the facts need to be examined to determine what a payment for injury to feelings relates to. The payment can be apportioned if necessary.</p><p>The Court of Appeal’s decision in Moorthy v HMRC discusses the amount of compensation that can reasonably be attributed to injury to feelings. The decision confirmed that such payments should be proportionate to the ‘Vento’ guidelines (see Vento v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police [2002] EWCA Civ 1871), which provide an indication of the amount that would have been awarded had the discrimination claims been settled at an Employment Tribunal. On that basis, the Court found that only £30,000 of the £200,000 paid to Mr Moorthy could be attributed to injury to feelings.</p><p>At para 79 of the decision, the Court indicated that taxpayers should not attempt to obtain exemption for much larger sums under the guise of a settlement of a discrimination claim. Where a payment is made as part of a settlement or compromise agreement, the amount attributed to injury to feelings should still be proportionate to the Vento guidelines.</p><p>The Vento guidelines are uplifted from time to time (most recently in April 2019). HMRC will look to apply the guidance in force at the date the settlement agreement is signed.</p><p>The ‘Walker’ and ‘Moorthy’ cases are both examples of a reasonable apportionment being made between compensation for loss of future earnings (which is taxable under s401) and compensation for injury to feelings (which may not be taxable if it is not connected to the termination of the employment).</p></div></div><div class="subsection-collection"/><nav class="gem-c-pagination" role="navigation" aria-label="Pagination"><ul class="gem-c-pagination__list" data-module="track-click"><li class="gem-c-pagination__item gem-c-pagination__item--previous"><a href="/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim12960" class="gem-c-pagination__link" rel="prev" data-track-category="contentsClicked" data-track-action="previous" data-track-label="/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim12960" data-track-dimension="previous" data-track-dimension-index="29"><span class="gem-c-pagination__link-title"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="gem-c-pagination__link-icon" height="13" width="17" viewbox="0 0 17 13"><path fill="currentColor" d="m6.5938-0.0078125-6.7266 6.7266 6.7441 6.4062 1.377-1.449-4.1856-3.9768h12.896v-2h-12.984l4.2931-4.293-1.414-1.414z"/></svg><span class="gem-c-pagination__link-text"> Previous page </span></span></a></li><li class="gem-c-pagination__item gem-c-pagination__item--next"><a href="/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim12970" class="gem-c-pagination__link" rel="next" data-track-category="contentsClicked" data-track-action="next" data-track-label="/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim12970" data-track-dimension="next" data-track-dimension-index="29"><span class="gem-c-pagination__link-title"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="gem-c-pagination__link-icon" height="13" width="17" viewbox="0 0 17 13"><path fill="currentColor" d="m10.107-0.0078125-1.4136 1.414 4.2926 4.293h-12.986v2h12.896l-4.1855 3.9766 1.377 1.4492 6.7441-6.4062-6.7246-6.7266z"/></svg><span class="gem-c-pagination__link-text"> Next page </span></span></a></li></ul></nav></article></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 33%; height: 0%; float:right;"><h3>Compared version</h3><hr/><article aria-labelledby="section-title"><h1 id="section-title" class="section-title">Termination payments and benefits: statutory compensation for discrimination and compensation for hurt feelings</h1><div class="body-content-wrapper"><div class="gem-c-govspeak govuk-govspeak " data-module="govspeak"><p> <p class="summary"><ins/></p><p><ins>This page has recently been updated.

The £64,947 element was taxable under s148 ICTA 1988 (now s401 ITEPA 2003) because it was connected to the termination of the individual’s employment. HMRC accepted that the £12,500 was not taxable on the basis that the Commissioners had found that all discrimination took place pre-termination.</ins></p><p><ins>In other circumstances, a payment for injury to feelings may be sufficiently connected to the termination to come within the scope of s401. Taxpayers may cite the case of Oti-Obihara v HMRC (2011 TC 00819) in which the First-Tier Tribunal found that s401 does not apply to compensation for non-financial losses. However, the Court of Appeal in Moorthy v HMRC (2018 EWCA Civ 847) indicated that the ‘Oti-Obihara’ case was wrongly decided by reference to an incorrect statutory test and should not be followed.</ins></p><p><ins>In Moorthy v HMRC, the termination itself was discriminatory (and there had been no previous discrimination during the employment) so all of the compensation fell within s401 (despite being within the scope of s401, the amount that could be attributed to injury to feelings was exempted under provisions which have now been amended).</ins></p><p><ins>Where the termination is discriminatory but there has also been discrimination during the employment, the facts need to be examined to determine what a payment for injury to feelings relates to. The payment can be apportioned if necessary.</ins></p><p><ins>The Court of Appeal’s decision in Moorthy v HMRC discusses the amount of compensation that can reasonably be attributed to injury to feelings. The decision confirmed that such payments should be proportionate to the ‘Vento’ guidelines (see Vento v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police [2002] EWCA Civ 1871), which provide an indication of the amount that would have been awarded had the discrimination claims been settled at an Employment Tribunal. On that basis, the Court found that only £30,000 of the £200,000 paid to Mr Moorthy could be attributed to injury to feelings.</ins></p><p><ins>At para 79 of the decision, the Court indicated that taxpayers should not attempt to obtain exemption for much larger sums under the guise of a settlement of a discrimination claim. Where a payment is made as part of a settlement or compromise agreement, the amount attributed to injury to feelings should still be proportionate to the Vento guidelines.</ins></p><p><ins>The Vento guidelines are uplifted from time to time (most recently in April 2019). HMRC will look to apply the guidance in force at the date the settlement agreement is signed.</ins></p><p><ins>The ‘Walker’ and ‘Moorthy’ cases are both examples of a reasonable apportionment being made between compensation for loss of future earnings (which is taxable under s401) and compensation for injury to feelings (which may not be taxable if it is not connected to the termination of the employment).</ins></p> </div></div><div class="subsection-collection"/><nav class="gem-c-pagination" role="navigation" aria-label="Pagination"><ul class="gem-c-pagination__list" data-module="track-click"><li class="gem-c-pagination__item gem-c-pagination__item--previous"><a href="/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim12960" class="gem-c-pagination__link" rel="prev" data-track-category="contentsClicked" data-track-action="previous" data-track-label="/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim12960" data-track-dimension="previous" data-track-dimension-index="29"><span class="gem-c-pagination__link-title">{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}path&gt;{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}svg&gt;<span class="gem-c-pagination__link-text">Previous page </span></span></a></li><li class="gem-c-pagination__item gem-c-pagination__item--next"><a href="/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim12970" class="gem-c-pagination__link" rel="next" data-track-category="contentsClicked" data-track-action="next" data-track-label="/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim12970" data-track-dimension="next" data-track-dimension-index="29"><span class="gem-c-pagination__link-title">{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}path&gt;{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}svg&gt;<span class="gem-c-pagination__link-text">Next page </span></span></a></li></ul></nav></article></div></div></body></html>
