This is <ins>illustrated</ins> <del>set out</del> below.</p><h3 id="example">Example</h3><p>In its accounting period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017, Company B has:</p><ul><li>Property business profits of £800,000, and</li><li>NTLRDs of £1,000,000.</li></ul><p>Here, the company has the option of apportioning only the carried-forward NTLRDs as in Example 1. However, as relief for NTLRDs against profits of the period in which they arise is included in <ins>F(2)A17/SCH4,</ins> <del>Schedule 4,</del> the company may instead apportion all the NTLRDs and profits of the period to the pre- and post-1 April 2017 periods under <ins>F(2)A17/PARA190 (2)(a):</ins> <del>Para 190(2)(a):</del> </p><table><thead><tr><th/><th>£</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1/1/17 to 31/3/17</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Property business profits</td><td>200,000</td></tr><tr><td>NTLRDs arising, set against profits of the notional period</td><td>(200,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Unused pre-1 April 2017 NTLRDs</td><td>(50,000)</td></tr><tr><td>1/4/17 to 31/12/17</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Non-trading profits</td><td>600,000</td></tr><tr><td>NTLRDs arising, set against profits of the notional period</td><td>(600,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Unused post-1 April 2017 NTLRDs</td><td>(150,000)</td></tr></tbody></table><p> <ins>PARA190 (2)(a)</ins> <del>Para 190(2)(a)</del> treats the periods to 31 March 2017 and from 1 April 2017 as separate accounting periods.

The same would apply if the company had treated NTLRDs in the same manner as the trading losses in Example 1.</p><p>If the company treats its NTLRDs as set out in Example 2, and, for example, chooses to surrender £20,000 from the first notional period beginning 1 January 2017 and ending 31 March 2017, the surrender period will be 1 January 2017 to 31 March 2017.</p><p>Apportionment of NTLRDs to this extent is entirely optional and is not required by HMRC.</p></div></div><div class="subsection-collection"/><nav class="gem-c-pagination" role="navigation" aria-label="Pagination"><ul class="gem-c-pagination__list" data-module="track-click"><li class="gem-c-pagination__item gem-c-pagination__item--previous"><a href="/hmrc-internal-manuals/company-taxation-manual/ctm04910" class="gem-c-pagination__link" rel="prev" data-track-category="contentsClicked" data-track-action="previous" data-track-label="/hmrc-internal-manuals/company-taxation-manual/ctm04910" data-track-dimension="previous" data-track-dimension-index="29"><span class="gem-c-pagination__link-title">{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}path&gt;{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}svg&gt;<span class="gem-c-pagination__link-text">Previous page </span></span></a></li><li class="gem-c-pagination__item gem-c-pagination__item--next"><a href="/hmrc-internal-manuals/company-taxation-manual/ctm04930" class="gem-c-pagination__link" rel="next" data-track-category="contentsClicked" data-track-action="next" data-track-label="/hmrc-internal-manuals/company-taxation-manual/ctm04930" data-track-dimension="next" data-track-dimension-index="29"><span class="gem-c-pagination__link-title">{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}path&gt;{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}svg&gt;<span class="gem-c-pagination__link-text">Next page </span></span></a></li></ul></nav></article></div></data>
