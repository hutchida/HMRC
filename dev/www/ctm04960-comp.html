If this amount <ins>were</ins> <del>was</del> surrendered to company F and apportioned on a time basis, the amount allocated to the first notional period would be £4,000,000 and the amount to the second notional period £12,000,000.</p><p>As the trade profits for the first notional period will be reduced to nil by trade losses brought forward, and the only other profits are NTLRCs of £1,500, the amount of group relief that can be used in that period is £1,500. The remaining £3,998,500 apportioned to the period cannot be used. HMRC accepts that this is a result that is unjust or unreasonable. Instead, company F can claim group relief equal to the amount that can be used in the first notional period, £1,500, and the amount apportioned to the second notional period, £12,000,000, which totals £12,001,500. HMRC accepts this alternative method of apportionment of £1,500 to the first notional period and £12,000,000 to the second notional period as this produces a result that is just and reasonable.</p><p/><h4 id="section"/><h4 id="step-3">Step 3</h4><p>Calculate the relevant maximum for the second notional period, in accordance with the loss restriction.</p><table><thead><tr><th>1/4/17 to 31/12/17</th><th>£</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Modified total profits <ins>(CTA10/S269ZF (3)</ins> <del>(CTA10/S269ZF(3)</del> step 1)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Trading profits</td><td>18,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>NTLRCs</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td/><td>18,004,500</td></tr><tr><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Trade profits </td><td>18,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Less amounts deducted from total trading profits (excluding brought forward trading losses) <ins>(S269ZF (3)</ins> <del>(S269ZF(3)</del> steps 2 and 4) (all allocated to trading profits):</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Group relief</td><td>(12,000,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Qualifying trade profits <ins>(S269ZF (3)</ins> <del>(S269ZF(3)</del> step 5)</td><td>6,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Relevant trading profits <ins>(S269ZF (1)</ins> <del>(S269ZF(1)</del> CTA10 (assume no deductions allowance)</td><td>6,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Relevant maximum <ins>(S269ZB (5)</ins> <del>(S269ZB(5)</del> </td><td>3,000,000</td></tr><tr><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Non-trade profits</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>NTLRCs</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td>Qualifying non-trading profits and relevant non-trading profits <ins>(S269ZF (3)</ins> <del>(S269ZF(3)</del> step 5 and </td></tr><tr> <ins>S269ZF (2))</ins><td><ins/></td><td><ins>Relevant maximum (S269ZC (3))</ins></td> <del>S269ZF(2) CTA10</del><td><del/></td><td><del>Relevant maximum (s269ZC(3))</del></td> </tr><td>2,250</td></tbody></table><p/><h4 id="step-4">Step 4</h4><p>Calculate the net result for the second notional period.</p><table><thead><tr><th>1/4/17 to 31/12/17</th><th>£</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Trade profits</td><td>18,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Less:</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Trade losses</td><td>(3,000,000)</td></tr><tr><td>NTLRCs</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td/><td>15,004,500</td></tr><tr><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Group relief</td><td>(12,000,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Net profits</td><td>3,004,500</td></tr></tbody></table><p/><h4 id="step-5">Step 5</h4><p>Compute the profits chargeable to Corporation Tax for the straddling accounting period.</p><table><thead><tr><th>1/1/17 to 31/12/17</th><th>£</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Trade profits</td><td>24,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Less:</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Trade losses</td><td>(9,000,000)</td></tr><tr><td>NTLRCs</td><td>6,000</td></tr><tr><td>Group relief</td><td>(12,001,500)</td></tr><tr><td>Profits chargeable to Corporation Tax</td><td>3,004,500</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Trade losses of £7,000,000 are carried forward to the period commencing 1 January 2018.
