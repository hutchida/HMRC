CTM48100 onwards explains what these are. Unit holders in authorised unit trusts, and shareholders in open-ended investment companies, may receive a share of the CIS’s investment income either in the form of an interest distribution or a dividend distribution (but not both together).</p><p>ITTOIA05/S373 (for OEICs) and ITTOIA05/S376 (for AUTs) taxes the interest distributions as interest, and UK individuals will almost always receive such distributions with tax taken off (CTM48600 outlines the circumstances in which gross payment can be made). The tax voucher which the investor receives from the CIS will make it clear whether the receipt is an interest or a dividend distribution.</p><p>An investor who holds accumulation units or shares, where the interest distribution is automatically reinvested in the fund, is still taxable on the distribution.</p><p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/savings-and-investment-manual/saim6000">SAIM6000</a> for more on collective investment schemes.</p><h3 id="industrial-and-provident-society-payments">Industrial and provident society payments</h3><p>A dividend, bonus or other sum payable to a shareholder in a registered industrial and provident society, or a UK agricultural or fishing co-operative, is treated as interest if it payable by reference to the person’s shareholding (ITTOIA05/S379). There is more detail about industrial and provident societies at CTM40500 onwards (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/savings-and-investment-manual/saim20000">SAIM20000</a>).</p><h3 id="price-differences-on-repos">Price differences on repos</h3><p>There is background on repos (sale and repurchase agreements) at CFM46100 (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/savings-and-investment-manual/saim20000">SAIM20000</a>). This explains that the repurchase price is normally equal to the original sale price plus an increment equivalent to interest on a loan of the same amount as the sale price for the period of the repo. Where the repurchase price is greater than the sale price the interim holder is treated for income tax purposes as receiving interest on a deemed loan to the original owner.
