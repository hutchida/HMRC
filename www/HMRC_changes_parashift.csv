PRT profit and losses are therefore calculated using the statutory procedure set out in OTA75 rather than by reference to profits shown in company accounts. The scope of PRT was significantly amended by OTA83 to reflect the more complex infrastructure arrangements which had developed by that date. Tariff and disposal receipts arising from the use of field assets were brought directly into charge and the provisions for apportioning expenditure between fields were altered.
