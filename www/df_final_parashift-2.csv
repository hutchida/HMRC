18983,OT03010,OT03010 PRT - Introduction,OT03010 PRT: Overview Of PRT - Introduction,"Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) was introduced by OTA75. It is essentially a tax on the profits from oil and gas production from the UK Continental Shelf. Unlike Corporation Tax, which is charged on the aggregate profit arising from all oil fields owned by a company, PRT is charged on each owner’s share of the profits of each individual oil field. PRT profit and losses are therefore calculated using the statutory procedure set out in OTA75 rather than by reference to profits shown in company accounts. The scope of PRT was significantly amended by OTA83 to reflect the more complex infrastructure arrangements which had developed by that date. Tariff and disposal receipts arising from the use of field assets were brought directly into charge and the provisions for apportioning expenditure between fields were altered.

Within the context of CT it is possible for an Inspector to see from the accounts that there has been a receipt which has been treated as non-taxable. The sort of items that are in mind are insurance receipts, compensation payments, recoveries from partners of payments made earlier. Where there is doubt as to whether these items should be taken into account for PRT purposes it will not be apparent to the Inspector who deals with the expenditure claim that the taxpayer may have taken the benefit of the doubt and claimed the gross payment or left out an item from the return of receipts. This may be a perfectly proper course of action but the Inspector is not in a position to consider the technical merits of the decision that has been taken unless he or she is aware of the item concerned. Companies should be encouraged to provide details of such receipts spontaneously.

The same will be true of a field which surrenders CFA. By contrast in the early years of development of a field (other than a donor of CFA) claims for expenditure relief under Schedules 5 and 6 may be made many years after the related accounts and CT computations have been submitted. Equally, where a taxpayer incurs exploration, appraisal or research expenditure but has no or limited PRT-liable field interests, claims for relief under Schedule 7 may not be made until many years have elapsed since the expenditure was incurred. In these circumstance there is no good reason why decisions should be taken on claims unless they can be seen to reconcile back to the accounts and computations that the OTO already hold. Similarly, in view of the long periods involved in the development of most fields claims for the early years should in future be submitted together with reconciliations as a matter of course and it will increasingly become the practice of OTO not to take decisions on such claims until they have been reconciled to the earlier accounts and CT computations.","For most of the taxes dealt with by the Inland Revenue it is not normal to adopt an audit approach to tax returns.

As regards expenditure, and particularly at the first claim stage, OTO’s examination methods involve some inspection of basic records and consideration of accounting systems, but it has always been recognised that this process falls well short of a full audit and the OTO would need further reassurance as to the accuracy of PRT claims and returns. This can only be achieved by a reconciliation of those claims and returns with the audited accounts and CT computations when they become available.",False

It would help this process if claims would identify the schedule within reconciliations where the expenditure unclaimed is recorded.,"For PRT as with any tax there will always be some items of income and occasionally some items of expenditure where the taxability or allowability of the payment may be in doubt. Within the context of CT it is possible for an Inspector to see from the accounts that there has been a receipt which has been treated as non-taxable. The sort of items that are in mind are insurance receipts, compensation payments, recoveries from partners of payments made earlier. Where there is doubt as to whether these items should be taken into account for PRT purposes it will not be apparent to the Inspector who deals with the expenditure claim that the taxpayer may have taken the benefit of the doubt and claimed the gross payment or left out an item from the return of receipts. This may be a perfectly proper course of action but the Inspector is not in a position to consider the technical merits of the decision that has been taken unless he or she is aware of the item concerned. Companies should be encouraged to provide details of such receipts spontaneously. However where they do not do so the PRT/Accounts reconciliation will disclose the existence of such receipts and provide the opportunity for the Inspector who deals with the claims to consider the technical merits of the company’s view.",False

The same will be true of a field which surrenders CFA. By contrast in the early years of development of a field (other than a donor of CFA) claims for expenditure relief under Schedules 5 and 6 may be made many years after the related accounts and CT computations have been submitted. Equally, where a taxpayer incurs exploration, appraisal or research expenditure but has no or limited PRT-liable field interests, claims for relief under Schedule 7 may not be made until many years have elapsed since the expenditure was incurred. In these circumstance there is no good reason why decisions should be taken on claims unless they can be seen to reconcile back to the accounts and computations that the OTO already hold. Similarly, in view of the long periods involved in the development of most fields claims for the early years should in future be submitted together with reconciliations as a matter of course and it will increasingly become the practice of OTO not to take decisions on such claims until they have been reconciled to the earlier accounts and CT computations.",False
