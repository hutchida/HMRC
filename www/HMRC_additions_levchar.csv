CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"The third requirement means that if the asset or liability will give rises to amounts treated as income under an accounts-based regime, the special treatment under S320 does not apply. The obvious example is amounts taken into account in determining the carrying value of inventory, typically something that takes some time to manufacture for sale, say an aircraft. In that case, S320 does not apply and the accounts are simply followed.",True
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"In addition, the treatment in S320 does not apply to amount taken to the carrying value of an intangible fixed asset to which a writing down at {fixed rate election applies [CTA09/S730]}. This therefore follows the position of other intangible fixed assets.",True
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,Effect,True
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"The effect of special treatment is that the amount is taken into account when capitalised, as if it were treated as an item of profit or loss. It then also follows that where an amount so treated gives rise to a debit on amortisation, depreciation or writing down, it is not taken into account for tax at that later time.",True
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"Computational adjustments must therefore be made when amortisation of an asset is taken to profit and loss account, or when an asset is sold, and the interest then appears in the profit and loss account.",True

CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"This treatment also applies where development costs, for example in the development phase of a new product, are capitalised. If the development costs are correctly treated as being in respect of a capital asset, the company will get relief for interest and other associated cost when they are incurred.",True

CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"Work in progress of, for example, a property developer, is not a fixed capital asset or project. Work in progress features in the income statement in the form of stock. It is circulating capital and not a capital asset of the company (see the Business Income Manual BIM35000+ on the distinction between fixed and circulating capital). Interest payable will be a debit in the profit and loss account but counterbalanced by an increase in work in progress. This does not mean that the interest has not been effectively debited to the profit and loss account. No adjustment will therefore be needed to ensure that relief is given for interest paid and taken to work in progress.",True

CG58060,CG58060 Rights Partially Qualify,V Ltd has acquired shares in P Ltd and a `notional security’ under section 138A. These are treated as two classes of shares or debentures. Together they form the `new holding’ under TCGA92/S127 as applied by TCGA92/S135(3).,True
CG58060,CG58060 Rights Partially Qualify,If the shares in P Ltd are not quoted the apportionment should be made by reference to market values at the date of a disposal of all or part of the new holding.,True
CG58060,CG58060 Rights Partially Qualify,C. RIGHT TO UNASCERTAINABLE DEFERRED CONSIDERATION,True
CG58060,CG58060 Rights Partially Qualify,The part satisfaction of the right to deferred consideration is a part disposal of the right. But because of section 138A it is treated as a conversion of securities within TCGA92/S132. TCGA92/S127 applies with the necessary adaptations to the part disposal and part of the base cost of the notional security is transferred to the holding of shares in P Ltd.,True
CG58060,CG58060 Rights Partially Qualify,The procedure for obtaining valuations of the right to unascertainable deferred consideration is described at CG14950.,True
CG58060,CG58060 Rights Partially Qualify,D. SHARES IN P LTD,True
CG58060,CG58060 Rights Partially Qualify,The shares in P Ltd which are acquired go into the TCGA92/S104 holding of shares of the same class. The base cost and indexed pool of expenditure is calculated in accordance with A and B above.,True

CG58070,CG58070 Right To Receive Qcbs,TCGA92/S138A applies to the fifty per cent of the consideration which could be received only in the form of shares. It cannot apply to the fifty per cent of the consideration that may be received in cash even if the cash alternative is not taken up. Section 138A(1)(d) requires that the right may only be satisfied by the issue of new debentures if it is to be an earn-out right to which section 138A can apply.,True

OT19140,OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),It is expected that the first reconciliations that are received from any company will need the most careful examination. Inspectors will need to satisfy themselves that the reconciliation has been competently performed and that all matters that need to be considered have been considered. It will be necessary for the Inspector to inform himself as to the detailed way in which the reconciliation has been completed and presented. Provided the method of doing the reconciliation remains consistent it is to be anticipated that future reconciliations will be agreed more readily. The greatest value in reconciliations will therefore have been achieved by the time the reconciliation is completed. By that time companies will probably have made any further claims that they feel they ought to have made and they will have notified OTO individually of over claims as they have been identified.,True

It is important therefore that as companies discover errors or over claims in the course of performing the reconciliations they bring them to OTO’s attention immediately without waiting for completion of the reconciliation.

OT19140,OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),"It is accepted that a totally balanced reconciliation will often prove difficult to achieve. Whatever method a company uses most exercises will finish with an unexplained difference.

In the final analysis it is a matter for judgement at what point and level an unexplained difference should be accepted. Clearly a difference representing excess PRT claimed expenditure over CT expenditure gives OTO more cause for concern than the reverse situation. It is in fact more likely on the evidence of completed reconciliations seen that the company will uncover PRT claimable but unclaimed expenditure as a result of the exercise. Additional expenditure claims submitted in these circumstances will be subjected to careful examination.
