CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"The third requirement means that if the asset or liability will give rises to amounts treated as income under an accounts-based regime, the special treatment under S320 does not apply. The obvious example is amounts taken into account in determining the carrying value of inventory, typically something that takes some time to manufacture for sale, say an aircraft. In that case, S320 does not apply and the accounts are simply followed."
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"In addition, the treatment in S320 does not apply to amount taken to the carrying value of an intangible fixed asset to which a writing down at {fixed rate election applies [CTA09/S730]}. This therefore follows the position of other intangible fixed assets."
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,Effect
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"The effect of special treatment is that the amount is taken into account when capitalised, as if it were treated as an item of profit or loss. It then also follows that where an amount so treated gives rise to a debit on amortisation, depreciation or writing down, it is not taken into account for tax at that later time."
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"Computational adjustments must therefore be made when amortisation of an asset is taken to profit and loss account, or when an asset is sold, and the interest then appears in the profit and loss account."
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,Examples
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,Development costs
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"This treatment also applies where development costs, for example in the development phase of a new product, are capitalised. If the development costs are correctly treated as being in respect of a capital asset, the company will get relief for interest and other associated cost when they are incurred."
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,Work in progress
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"Work in progress of, for example, a property developer, is not a fixed capital asset or project. Work in progress features in the income statement in the form of stock. It is circulating capital and not a capital asset of the company (see the Business Income Manual BIM35000+ on the distinction between fixed and circulating capital). Interest payable will be a debit in the profit and loss account but counterbalanced by an increase in work in progress. This does not mean that the interest has not been effectively debited to the profit and loss account. No adjustment will therefore be needed to ensure that relief is given for interest paid and taken to work in progress."
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,Incidental costs of purchase of shares in a subsidiary
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"Normally, it is correct accounting practice to spread the costs of loan finance used to buy shares. However, CTA09/S320 applies to allow relief in the year in which the costs were incurred and capitalised where"
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"the shares are held as a fixed capital asset, and"
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"the incidental costs come within CTA09/S306A(2), (previously CTA09/307(4)), and"
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,it is generally accepted accounting practice to capitalise such costs.
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,Position for accounting periods beginning before 1 January 2016
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"Profits and losses from loan relationships include capital profits and losses (CTA09/S293(3)), but amounts brought into account are those recognised in a statement of the company’s profit or loss for the period or in reserves (CFM33100)."
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"Interest and other expenses relating to a loan taken out to fund capital expenditure, may be taken to a fixed capital asset account. This therefore follows a similar position as outlined above in respect of accounting periods from 1 January 2016."
CFM42100,CFM42100 Exchange Gains And Losses,"Consequently, S486B(8) makes it clear that the amounts to be brought into account under the disguised interest rules would be as follows:"

CG58060,CG58060 Rights Partially Qualify,EXPLANATION
CG58060,CG58060 Rights Partially Qualify,The statutory reasons for the method of computation are:
CG58060,CG58060 Rights Partially Qualify,A. COST OF SHARES IN P LTD
CG58060,CG58060 Rights Partially Qualify,V Ltd has acquired shares in P Ltd and a `notional security’ under section 138A. These are treated as two classes of shares or debentures. Together they form the `new holding’ under TCGA92/S127 as applied by TCGA92/S135(3).
CG58060,CG58060 Rights Partially Qualify,If the shares in P Ltd are not quoted the apportionment should be made by reference to market values at the date of a disposal of all or part of the new holding.
CG58060,CG58060 Rights Partially Qualify,C. RIGHT TO UNASCERTAINABLE DEFERRED CONSIDERATION
CG58060,CG58060 Rights Partially Qualify,The part satisfaction of the right to deferred consideration is a part disposal of the right. But because of section 138A it is treated as a conversion of securities within TCGA92/S132. TCGA92/S127 applies with the necessary adaptations to the part disposal and part of the base cost of the notional security is transferred to the holding of shares in P Ltd.
CG58060,CG58060 Rights Partially Qualify,The procedure for obtaining valuations of the right to unascertainable deferred consideration is described at CG14950.
CG58060,CG58060 Rights Partially Qualify,D. SHARES IN P LTD
CG58060,CG58060 Rights Partially Qualify,The shares in P Ltd which are acquired go into the TCGA92/S104 holding of shares of the same class. The base cost and indexed pool of expenditure is calculated in accordance with A and B above.
CG58070,CG58070 Right To Receive Qcbs,This example illustrates the computation where only part of the deferred consideration has to be satisfied by an issue of shares.
CG58070,CG58070 Right To Receive Qcbs,"NOTE From 6 April 2008 only companies and other concerns within the charge to Corporation Tax may be able to claim indexation allowance, see CG17207."
CG58070,CG58070 Right To Receive Qcbs,FACTS
CG58070,CG58070 Right To Receive Qcbs,"In year 0 V Ltd acquires all the shares in T Ltd for £100,000."
CG58070,CG58070 Right To Receive Qcbs,In year 10 V Ltd sells all the shares in T Ltd at arm’s length to P Ltd.
CG58070,CG58070 Right To Receive Qcbs,"The consideration is the right to two payments of deferred consideration, the amount depending on the future profits of T Ltd. Fifty per cent of the amount will be satisfied in shares of P Ltd, with the remaining fifty per cent to be satisfied in any combination of shares or cash at V Ltd’s request."
CG58070,CG58070 Right To Receive Qcbs,"The market value of the right to receive deferred consideration at the time of disposal is agreed by Shares and Assets Valuation at £800,000."
CG58070,CG58070 Right To Receive Qcbs,"In year 11 V Ltd receives shares in P Ltd to the value £680,000 (200,000 shares at £3.40 each) in part satisfaction of the right to deferred consideration. The market value of the remainder of the right is agreed by Shares and Assets Valuation to be £300,000."
CG58070,CG58070 Right To Receive Qcbs,"In year 12 shares in P Ltd to the value £350,000 (100,000 shares at £3.50 each) are issued in full satisfaction of the remainder of the right to deferred consideration."
CG58070,CG58070 Right To Receive Qcbs,TCGA92/S138A applies to the fifty per cent of the consideration which could be received only in the form of shares. It cannot apply to the fifty per cent of the consideration that may be received in cash even if the cash alternative is not taken up. Section 138A(1)(d) requires that the right may only be satisfied by the issue of new debentures if it is to be an earn-out right to which section 138A can apply.

CG58070,CG58070 Right To Receive Qcbs,EXPLANATION
CG58070,CG58070 Right To Receive Qcbs,A) IMMEDIATE CHARGEABLE GAIN
CG58070,CG58070 Right To Receive Qcbs,There is an immediate chargeable gain on the proportion of the right to receive unascertainable deferred consideration which does not fall within section 138A. The disposal consideration is the value of that part of the right (supplied by Shares and Assets Valuation).
CG58070,CG58070 Right To Receive Qcbs,C)i) CHARGEABLE GAINS ON RECEIPT OF DEFERRED CONSIDERATION
CG58070,CG58070 Right To Receive Qcbs,There is a disposal or part disposal of the `right’ when the deferred consideration is received in satisfaction or part satisfaction of the `right’. The cost of the right to receive unascertainable deferred consideration is the value which has been brought into the computation of the immediate chargeable gain. CG14970 explains this in more detail.
CG58070,CG58070 Right To Receive Qcbs,D) SHARES IN P LTD
CG58070,CG58070 Right To Receive Qcbs,All of the shares in P Ltd which are acquired go into the same pool. The shares to which section 138A did not apply go into the pool at market value at the date of acquisition. The shares to which section 138A did apply go into the pool with the base cost (and indexation) which has been calculated as if there was no disposal of the original shares.

CH82180,CH82180 More Than One Inaccuracy,Grouping
CH82180,CH82180 More Than One Inaccuracy,Strictly you should calculate the PLR and penalty for each inaccuracy individually. This means that the computation can be a lengthy process.

CTM21270,CTM21270 How Legislation Operated In Practice: Summary,"9) If a company was found not to be an IHC for an accounting period, it was liable to account for ACT on any FID paid (net of FID received).

CTM22010,CTM22010 Introduction,"The calculation of ACT, see CTM22060, is based on the amount of franked payments made in that accounting period less franked investment income received in that accounting period (as long as the tax credit comprised in the franked investment income has not been paid to the company following a claim under ICTA88/S231 (2))."

CTM22060,CTM22060 Of Returns,"In a return period a company has made franked payments of £10,000 (that is, £8,000 dividend paid plus ACT £2,000), and received £4,000 franked investment income."
CTM22060,CTM22060 Of Returns,"The ACT is calculated by applying the lower rate of IT to the difference between the franked payments and franked investment income, which is £10,000 - £4,000 = £6,000. ACT is 20% of £6,000 = £1,200."
CTM22060,CTM22060 Of Returns,"Strictly, the ACT is calculated on an amount which when the ACT is added to it, is equal to the excess of franked payments over franked investment income. In this example the amount of ACT is a quarter of £4,800 i.e. £1,200 - which together with £4,800 gives the excess of £6,000."
CTM22060,CTM22060 Of Returns,Franked investment income cannot be included in this calculation if the associated tax credit has been paid to the company following a claim under ICTA88/S231 (2) (repealed with effect from 6 April 1999 onwards).

This is not a normal commercial loan (CTM81010 ‘normal commercial loan’), so Company J is an equity holder (CTM81010 ‘equity holder’) in respect of it. But the share of the Company H’s assets to which Company J is entitled on a winding-up is limited to £100,000, the amount of the loan. The loan is a security with limited rights."

IPT07300,IPT07300 Bad Debt Relief,"Where an insurer uses the cash receipt method and deals directly with the insured (i.e. payment is not made through a broker) there is effectively automatic bad debt relief: no receipt of cash by the insurer means there is no tax point and thus no requirement to account for tax. However, as explained immediately above, where a broker receives a premium on behalf of an insurer using the cash receipt scheme and the broker subsequently fails to pay that premium to the insurer, the insurer is still required to account for the tax."
IPT07800,IPT07800 Transitional Accounting Arrangements: Contents,IPT07865    Guidance relating to periods prior to 1 June 2017
IPT07805,IPT07805 Purpose And Outline Of This Section,"Any transitional provisions are contained in the Finance Act in which the change in rate is announced. For example, section 125 of the Finance Act 1999 contains the transitional arrangements, where the rate was increased from 4% to 5% and section 17 of the Finance Act 2017 contains the transitional arrangements, where the rate was increased from 10% to 12%."
IPT07810,IPT07810 Cash Receipt Method,"Before the rate rise contained in Finance Act 2017, there were no transitional accounting arrangements for insurers using the cash receipt method. If a premium, including an additional premium (AP), was received on or after the implementation date of the change in rate in respect of a taxable risk, IPT was due at the new rate. This would be the case even if the premium or AP related to a policy which related wholly to a period prior to that date."
IPT07810,IPT07810 Cash Receipt Method,Rate Rise from 1 June 2017
IPT07810,IPT07810 Cash Receipt Method,"Following consultation with the industry, the rate rise on 1 June 2017 marked a change in approach to transitional arrangements. The rise should now apply in the same way to both cash receipt and special accounting scheme businesses. "
IPT07810,IPT07810 Cash Receipt Method,The key determinants of whether the new rate applies to any premium received on after the date of the rate rise are:
IPT07810,IPT07810 Cash Receipt Method,Does the premium relate to a risk for which the cover commenced on or after the rate rise date; or
IPT07810,IPT07810 Cash Receipt Method,"Notwithstanding the above test, is the premium received on or after the first anniversary of the rate rise date."
IPT07820,IPT07820 Additional Premiums,Example 5
IPT07820,IPT07820 Additional Premiums,"Contractor’s all risk policy incepting on the 1 March 2017. The contract covers a development due to be completed in scheduled stages. The exact dates for completion are initially unknown as is the premium that will be due. A deposit premium is initially charged and at pre-determined points, additional premiums are charged to reflect where the development has got to. Any additional premium charged under the contract before 1 June 2018 will be subject to the 10% rate of tax."
IPT07820,IPT07820 Additional Premiums,Please note that the above examples apply as described unless the anti- forestalling rules explained in IPT07840 take effect.
IPT07825,IPT07825 Monthly Written Contracts,It is important to distinguish monthly contracts from contracts for longer periods which are paid by monthly instalments. This will affect the tax point and (where there is a rate change) the rate of tax due.
IPT07830,IPT07830 Premiums Paid On A Monthly Or Other Regular Basis,the contract is for a period of not more than 12 months;
IPT07830,IPT07830 Premiums Paid On A Monthly Or Other Regular Basis,"the premiums are paid in advance in their entirety, rather than just the tax."
IPT07830,IPT07830 Premiums Paid On A Monthly Or Other Regular Basis,Tax credits
IPT07830,IPT07830 Premiums Paid On A Monthly Or Other Regular Basis,Tax credit on returned premiums should be claimed at the IPT rate applicable to the original premium.
IPT07835,IPT07835 The Effect Of A Rate Change On De Minimis Policies,"The IPT on the original premium may be accounted for at the same time as tax is accounted for on the additional premium, i.e. 1 January 2018."
IPT07850,IPT07850 Penalties On Errors Relating To The Rate Changes,"The tax has been in operation for a number of years and we expect insurers to be familiar with its operation. Penalties and interest as a result of errors made by insurers relating to changes in the rate of tax or to any extension of the higher rate, will be assessed on a case by case basis."

IPT08050,IPT08050 Purpose And Outline Of IPT08000,"Tax planning has become a major activity among registered traders in all tax regimes. Businesses seek to reduce their costs and their exposure to tax by structuring and organising their affairs to minimise legitimately the amount of tax to which they are liable. This process requires a close attention to the law dealing with the relevant taxes. The Department deals with advisers whose first resort is to the law. To deal with this you have to be familiar with the IPT law contained in the relevant Finance Acts, the IPT Regulations, and the Financial Services and Markets Act. IPT03000 provides an overview of the law; however it is not a substitute for the legislation."
IPT08210,IPT08210 The Law,A new framework for Information and Inspection Powers was put into operation by HMRC for IPT. Please refer to Compliance Handbook (CH21060) for further details.
IPT08485,IPT08485 Tax Treatment Of Add-Ons,"The separate company is an authorised insurer providing the services under a Class 18 contract of insurance. There are two supplies of direct insurance to the policyholder: one of motor breakdown insurance by the Class 18 insurer, and one of the remaining cover by the other insurer. The policyholder will either have a single contract to which both insurers are party, or two contracts. The premium charged by each insurer will bear IPT, and each insurer is liable to account for IPT on their share of the premium. This is the situation described at b. in IPT08480."
IPT08485,IPT08485 Tax Treatment Of Add-Ons,"An insurer providing the Class 18 motor breakdown insurance is providing insurance to the primary insurer (see c. in IPT08480). The primary insurer undertakes to ensure that the breakdown service is provided to the policyholder in certain circumstances. The primary insurer becomes liable to pay for the breakdown services, and he lays off the cost of this to a second insurer for a premium of £15 per policyholder. The second insurer procures the breakdown services in order to meet his obligations under the insurance contract with the primary insurer. The insurance premium paid by the direct insurer to the secondary insurer is subject to IPT, as is the premium paid by the policyholder to the primary insurer."
IPT08500,IPT08500 Visits To Lloyd's,Motor syndicates
IPT08500,IPT08500 Visits To Lloyd's,"Motor syndicates, which are not included in the composite Lloyd’s return, have their own separate systems of accounting for IPT. You should follow normal audit assurance procedures for these syndicates. Many motor syndicates also write a small amount of non-motor business, which is processed through LPSO. There is a potential risk that the IPT relating to this business is omitted from the syndicate’s return. Officers who visit motor syndicates and wish to establish if any business is processed through the LPSO, or confirm the details of such business, should contact the Lloyd’s assurance team."

This must explain what action is now needed by the business in order to become compliant with each of the Regulations, and the timescale for becoming compliant. This should be as detailed as possible because the Compliance Officer who conducts the next Compliance Visit will use this as a reference point to establish if the breaches have been corrected."
MLR1PP11100,What To Include In A Pre-Penalty Notice,"Details of any other action the business should take to become fully compliant. This must be included in the notice when other procedural weaknesses have been identified which currently are not serious enough to warrant a penalty. This is a warning to the business that in addition to correcting the breaches for which they have been penalised, they must also correct these other weaknesses for which they are now being warned, otherwise these will also be subject to a penalty in the future. This is effectively a warning letter embedded into a penalty notice. Further information about warning letters can be found in MLR1PP6000."

OT05025,OT05025 PRT: Computation - Arm's Length Rule,Interpretation for sales before 1st July 2006:
OT05025,OT05025 PRT: Computation - Arm's Length Rule,"OTA75\SCH3\PARA1(1)(c) applies where the interest is direct or indirect. This therefore means that sales using net-back prices are not at arm’s length, e.g. A sells gas to B who sells to a range of end-users and the sale price payable to A is a proportion of the aggregate of B’s on-sale prices."
OT05025,OT05025 PRT: Computation - Arm's Length Rule,Interpretation for sales on or after 1st July 2006:
OT05025,OT05025 PRT: Computation - Arm's Length Rule,"Such sales are now considered to be made on Arm’s length terms. For example, company A and company B are both 100% subsidiaries of company C. Company A sells all of its equity crude oil entitlement from Aardvark field to company B, which is the group’s marketing company. Company B then sells all of that oil and other oil that it has bought from third parties to another company, D, which has no relationship to A, B or C."
OT05025,OT05025 PRT: Computation - Arm's Length Rule,"The terms of the “1st pass” sales from A to B are on a standard floating basis, based upon the average of a Price Reporting Agency’s benchmark crude oil assessments around the Bill of Lading, with a differential of $0.50 per barrel. The “2nd pass” sale from B to D is on the identical floating basis but with a differential of $0.55 per barrel. Because of the facts and circumstances surrounding the sales the difference of 5 cents is considered in this instance to be a reasonable marketing fee, so the price received by A is considered to be a reasonable arm’s-length price."
OT05030,OT05030 PRT: Computation - The Arms Length Rule - Examples,In a transaction that does involve a sale it is necessary then to examine whether the various conditions are satisfied.
OT05030,OT05030 PRT: Computation - The Arms Length Rule - Examples,"In Example 3 above, suppose that A disposes of equity in the July leg of the spread. Even if the deal is regarded as two separately negotiated sale transactions, the consideration for A’s sale is not just the price of $16.50."
OT05030,OT05030 PRT: Computation - The Arms Length Rule - Examples,"A would not enter the sale without having B’s agreement to the reciprocal transaction and vice versa. There is a mutual exchange of promises which constitutes consideration, additional to the prices in the contracts, and in neither case is the first condition in Para1 satisfied. Also the terms of each sale are affected by the wider bargain in that there is an implied condition in each transaction that the reciprocal transaction is effected; or alternatively, it could be argued that the terms of each sale would not exist but for the other transaction."
OT05030,OT05030 PRT: Computation - The Arms Length Rule - Examples,"The same arguments apply in Example 4 but Example 5 is somewhat different. In this latter case there is only one transaction between A and B and no circle around which an exchange of mutual promises can be made. So there is no consideration other than the price, nor is there a wider bargain between the parties (or of which the parties are part) which can affect the terms of the transaction. In practice a careful examination of all the facts would be necessary but unless there are some other factors present, it is likely that the sale from A to B would qualify as arm’s length."
OT05080,OT05080 Currency Translation - Practical Application,The PRT exchange convention can have significant effects in dealing with the CT adjustments required by ICTA88\S493 (the substitution for the purposes CT of PRT market value for consideration in all non-arm’s length transactions).

OT05325,OT05325 Crude Oils And Products - How To Calculate Category 1 Values,"This “market price” is then multiplied by the volume of oil to be valued to give the total market value.

OT15210,OT15210 Receipts - Participators In Common,"Which of these approaches is the correct one for any transaction depends on the facts and the legal relationships involved. Consideration should be given to what, as a matter of law, is the proper construction of the transaction agreement and the agreements governing the relationships of the parties (including the Joint Operating Agreement). Although there may be differences of opinion between the various parties concerning the interpretation of the facts and the documents, there will only be one correct position. It is therefore unlikely that different treatment will be agreed with individual parties to a transaction."

OT19025,OT19025 PRT: Appendices - Valuation Of LPG,UKOITC accepted the OTO’s invitation to discuss the details (both theoretical and practical) of the 2 tier market and agreed that discussions with individual companies would be the most practical route.

OT19040,OT19040 PRT: Appendices - Review Of LPG Methodology,"We have now completed our review of the market and are content that the methodology agreed in 1988 remains appropriate for valuing. Your agreement to this is noted and valuations for 2H1993 will be issued using the current methodology. However, there are a couple of points arising from your letter."
OT19040,OT19040 PRT: Appendices - Review Of LPG Methodology,"From the review of the market it does not appear that the central features identified in the discussions in 1987/88 have altered materially; security of offtake, cost of infrastructure required and the complexities of freight remain the major determinants of trade in LPG. This is reflected in your letter and paper. Furthermore, companies have argued that the difference between OTO and posted prices will diminish as North Sea LPG production increases over the next two years. If, however, despite this increase, significant variations continued and the nature of the market remains as described above, I see no reason for further review of the methodology."
OT19040,OT19040 PRT: Appendices - Review Of LPG Methodology,In view of the variation between OTO and agreed prices at present I do not consider that a proposal under SP14\93 for the disposal of LPGs reflecting posted prices and no premium would be appropriate.

OT19125,OT19125 PRT: Appendices - Extra Statutory Concessions,"By concession, a participator is also to be entitled, again on giving notice to the Board, to withhold the instalment for a month if in the previous or an earlier month, oil actually ceased to be won from the field as a result of some sudden catastrophic loss of or damage to production, transportation or initial treatment facilities relating to the field, and has not recommenced."
OT19140,OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),The fact that reconciliations have been received in OTO should be taken into account by each Inspector with PRT responsibilities for the taxpayer and for each field in which the company is a participator in examining claims.
OT19140,OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),It is expected that the first reconciliations that are received from any company will need the most careful examination. Inspectors will need to satisfy themselves that the reconciliation has been competently performed and that all matters that need to be considered have been considered. It will be necessary for the Inspector to inform himself as to the detailed way in which the reconciliation has been completed and presented. Provided the method of doing the reconciliation remains consistent it is to be anticipated that future reconciliations will be agreed more readily. The greatest value in reconciliations will therefore have been achieved by the time the reconciliation is completed. By that time companies will probably have made any further claims that they feel they ought to have made and they will have notified OTO individually of over claims as they have been identified.
OT19140,OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),"Paragraph 9 Schedule 2 OTA 1975 provides that where any return statement, declaration or accounts as are mentioned in Paragraph 8 Schedule 2 were made or submitted by any person neither fraudulently nor negligently and it comes to his notice those were incorrect then, unless the error is remedied without unreasonable delay, the return statement, declaration or account shall be treated as having been negligently made or submitted by the first mentioned person. It is important therefore that as companies discover errors or over claims in the course of performing the reconciliations they bring them to OTO’s attention immediately without waiting for completion of the reconciliation. This will ensure that in cases where the original error was not one arising from negligence that Para 9 does not operate to treat it as such."

OT19140,OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),Results
OT19140,OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),"It is accepted that a totally balanced reconciliation will often prove difficult to achieve. Whatever method a company uses most exercises will finish with an unexplained difference. As far as seems reasonable, having regard to the amount of the difference both in absolute terms and in relation to total expenditure, the company should endeavour to establish the reason or likely reason for the difference. In the final analysis it is a matter for judgement at what point and level an unexplained difference should be accepted. Clearly a difference representing excess PRT claimed expenditure over CT expenditure gives OTO more cause for concern than the reverse situation. It is in fact more likely on the evidence of completed reconciliations seen that the company will uncover PRT claimable but unclaimed expenditure as a result of the exercise. Additional expenditure claims submitted in these circumstances will be subjected to careful examination. Where for time limit reasons such an additional claim is submitted before submission and examination of the reconciliation concerned, examination of the PRT claim may need to be deferred until the reconciliation is submitted and examined."
OT19140,OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),When further claims are made as a result of a reconciliation it is not enough for a company to identify the existence of unclaimed amounts. There may have been good reason for not claiming the expenditure. Thus claims arising from a reconciliation must identify the nature of the expenditure and demonstrate that it is allowable in the particular field or under Schedule 7.

Where returns have been deferred by more than one year, the new legislation provides that assessments can be made up to 5 years after the earlier of the deferred delivery date and the date of delivery of the return. There is no need for a similar provision for loss determinations as these can be made at any time."

OT19200,OT19200 PRT: Appendices - Deferral Of PRT Returns,"Where part of an interest in an oil field is transferred, Paragraph 5 of Schedule17, FA 1980 requires the notice under Paragraph 3 to state “what the old and new participators propose should be the corresponding part of” unused expenditure relief, unused losses, accumulated capital expenditure and (where there is excluded oil) oil won and saved. Normally OTO expects these to be agreed amounts but where the old participator has not made claims and has not had losses determined this will not be possible. OTO will therefore accept clear statements of intent."
OT19200,OT19200 PRT: Appendices - Deferral Of PRT Returns,"Assume for example, that old participator ‘A’ sells his interest to new participators ‘B’ and ‘C’. The normal operation of PRT means that all expenditure incurred up to the end of the chargeable period immediately preceding the date of transfer will remain available to ‘A’, subject only to decisions not having been taken before the assessment for that period has been issued. So the statement of intent for the treatment of expenditure could be in terms that expenditure incurred after the end of the chargeable period ended on … plus any earlier expenditure on which no decision has been taken at the time the assessment for that chargeable period is made will be shared between ‘B’ and ‘C’ in the ratio X : Y."
OT19200,OT19200 PRT: Appendices - Deferral Of PRT Returns,"Similarly, in respect of any accumulated loss as at the date of transfer (i.e. once all assessments and loss determinations have been made for all chargeable periods up to and including the one that includes the transfer date), ‘A’ could state that X% will be transferred to ‘B’ and Y% to ‘C’. The proposal for transferring accumulated capital expenditure could be couched in similar terms."

PIM2056,PIM2056 Restriction For Income Tax Purposes From 2017/18: Apportionment,Example 5
PIM2056,PIM2056 Restriction For Income Tax Purposes From 2017/18: Apportionment,Plush Properties LLP carries on a large property rental business with a substantial number of both residential and commercial properties. From time to time it takes out loans to acquire new properties or to fund specific work needed on particular properties. It calculates the finance cost restriction for those loans using one of the methods in examples 1 to 3 above.
PIM2056,PIM2056 Restriction For Income Tax Purposes From 2017/18: Apportionment,"It also has a revolving overdraft facility with its bank, which it draws on from time to time to fund general working capital costs for the property business as a whole. To decide how much of the overdraft interest is subject to the ‘dwelling-related loan’ restrictions, Plush Properties LLP compares the rents received from the residential properties against those from the commercial properties. 30% of the rent is from residential properties, so Plush Properties LLP applies the ‘dwelling-related loan’ restriction to that proportion of the overdraft interest for the year. "
PIM2056,PIM2056 Restriction For Income Tax Purposes From 2017/18: Apportionment,"There may be other acceptable methods of apportioning finance costs where those costs have arisen from a loan or credit facility to provide general working capital for the business. For instance, it may be appropriate in some cases to calculate the apportionment based on the amount of staff time devoted to each element of the business. We expect businesses to apply their appropriate methodology consistently unless there were good reason to change."
PIM2056,PIM2056 Restriction For Income Tax Purposes From 2017/18: Apportionment,"Businesses may have in place a revolving credit or overdraft facility for a number of years, to provide capital to acquire new properties, make improvements on properties and/or to fund general working capital. The balance outstanding could also reflect the proceeds of property sales and other receipts. It may not be practical or possible to accurately attribute the proportions of the borrowings that relate to the dwelling-house(s) and other parts of the property business at a particular time. It may then be acceptable for the apportionment to be made for a year on the basis of the relative proportions of dwelling-house(s) and other properties in the portfolio at that time."
PIM2056,PIM2056 Restriction For Income Tax Purposes From 2017/18: Apportionment,"When making such an apportionment it should be remembered that the purpose of borrowing money is to finance real cash spending and, in this context, the acquisition of real property. So the apportionment should be made on the basis of the original costs (including any improvements) of the properties rather than their current valuation."
PIM2056,PIM2056 Restriction For Income Tax Purposes From 2017/18: Apportionment,"Whatever method is adopted to arrive at a just and reasonable apportionment, we expect a business would be able to justify that method by reference to its records. It is not acceptable for businesses to deem, without evidence, portions of their borrowing as relating to a particular property or type of property in order to contrive to minimise the restriction on the interest that may be deducted."
PIM2056,PIM2056 Restriction For Income Tax Purposes From 2017/18: Apportionment,Example 6
PIM2056,PIM2056 Restriction For Income Tax Purposes From 2017/18: Apportionment,"A property business has been in existence for many years and has a single account through which all business receipts and borrowings are made. Over the life of the business there have been many property acquisitions, refurbishments and sales but at 6 April 2017 it owns ten properties. These are six residential with a total original cost of £2m and four commercial with a total original cost of £6m. So for 2017/18, 2/8 (25%) of the costs of borrowing would be considered to refer to residential properties (and be restricted in accordance with PIM2056) and 6/8 (75%) would refer to commercial properties and be allowable."
PIM2056,PIM2056 Restriction For Income Tax Purposes From 2017/18: Apportionment,"Where a business has a single account/borrowing facility for the whole business with no separate tranches of borrowings for specific purposes, it is not possible to ascertain whether a repayment relates to a specific property. We would not accept a method whereby a repayment or reduction of such a facility is deemed to relate to a particular type of property. Instead the repayment is of the loan facility as a whole and the interest costs must be apportioned on a just and reasonable basis."

PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,Before reaching first split normal pension age
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,The following example is based on a ‘Barber’ case but the same principles would apply in relation to other cases where some of a member’s benefits under a registered pension scheme have one ‘normal pension age’ and some have another.
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,The following data is used for the purpose of this example.
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,The pension formula for the pension scheme on retiring at ‘normal pension age’ is:
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,1/60 x pensionable service x final pensionable salary
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,‘Normal pension age’ under the scheme is effectively ‘split’ according to service as follows:
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,6 April 1987 - 5 April 1991 (normal pension age 60)
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,6 April 1991 onwards (normal pension age 65)
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,"meaning that if the member retires from service at any time before age 65, the 6 April 1991 onward part will be reduced by an age related factor; and if the member retires from service before age 60 the 1987-1991 part will be reduced by an age related factor (i.e. below these respective ages the member does not have right to an unreduced pension, and these are respectively the earliest age for which this is true). So these are the relevant assumed ages for the purposes of the valuation assumptions used for pension input amount calculations. This is the meaning of normal pension age throughout this example."
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,"On retiring from active service between age 60 and 65, the 1987-1991 part may be salary-linked, or it may be uplifted by late retirement factors past age 60, or it might be set by whichever of these two would give the better higher pension. As shown in the example below, these differing approaches do not affect the pension input amount prior to the member reaching age 60."
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,Pension input period is: 6 April to 5 April
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,Member’s pensionable service:
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,Joined on 6 April 1987 and has 4 years of service at ‘normal pension age 60’
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,"At 5 April 2011, the end of the previous pension input period, age = 54 (i.e. below age 60) and the member had 20 years service with ‘normal pension age 65’."
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,"At end of current pension input period, age = 55 (i.e. also below age 60)"

PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,"Pension input amount is £1,120,000 - £1,055,744 = £64,256"
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,Conclusion
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,"Each part of the benefit with a different ‘normal pension age’ should be calculated by reference to that normal pension age for annual allowance purposes (i.e. just because this is all in one arrangement, this does not mean one must determine a single normal pension age to be applied for the whole arrangement for the purpose of the pension input amount calculation.)"
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,The calculations are done for each part of the benefit and then aggregated to find the pension input amount for the arrangement as a whole. (Note that negative values at intermediate stages are not set to zero. It is only if the aggregate value for the whole arrangement is negative that the overall pension input amount is then set to zero.)
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,The outcome is the same as if no ‘split’ normal pension age were in play.
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,"Also, the outcome in many cases, including this particular case, would be the same if the ‘normal pension age 60’ part and the ‘normal pension age 65’ part of the benefit were in separate arrangements. (However, note that this will not always be true. For example, negative pension input amount values may arise where there are separate arrangements (and each have to be set to zero), that would be treated differently (see above) if the arrangement were a single one. This is not a special feature of split normal pension age cases, but is here for completeness.)"

PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,"Scenarios 1, 2 and 3 show different ways in which each part of the benefit might be required to be treated under a scheme’s rules, and how this, in turn, has a bearing on the calculation of the pension input amount; and how the outcome could depend on whether benefits are all within one arrangement or not. In particular this latter point reflects the fact that the ‘deferred member carve out’ is applied on an arrangement by arrangement basis (i.e. looks at each arrangement as though other arrangements do not exist for the member in the scheme)."
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,The following data is used for the purpose of this example.

PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,‘Normal pension age’ for benefits under the scheme is effectively ‘split’ according to service as follows:
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,meaning that if the member retires from service at any time before age 65 the 1988-1990 and 6 April 1995 onward parts will be reduced by an age related factor; and if the member retires from service before age 60 the 1990-1995 part will be reduced by an age related factor.
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,"The following shows how the pension input amount might differ depending on whether, by continuing in active service between age 60 and 65, the 1990-1995 part is salary-linked, or is uplifted by a late retirement factor or is set by whichever of these two would give the better higher pension."
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,Pension input period is 6 April - 5 April

PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,"For pension input periods before reaching age 60, the pension input amount is calculated on the basis that each part of the benefit with a different normal pension age is calculated by reference to that normal pension age (as explained in](#Before) section above). It does not matter whether each part of the benefits relating to the ‘normal pension age 60’ and ‘normal pension age 65’ are all in the same arrangements or different ones (unless there are differences arising from negative values, as explained in Before reaching first split normal pension age section above). This means that the fact of ‘split normal pension age’ does not impact on the calculations."
PTM053330,PTM053330 Worked Examples: ‘Split Normal Pension Ages’,"Once the member exceeds age 60, then how the pension input amount is calculated depends on the way the benefits are set to grow under the scheme rules, and sometimes also the underlying nature of the benefits that would actually have emerged given the facts at the relevant opening and closing dates of the pension input period. But it also depends on whether the benefit is in one arrangement or split between arrangements."
PTM092200,PTM092200 Protecting Pre-April 2006 Pension Rights: Divorce,Where pension sharing occurs the amount awarded to an ex-spouse or former civil partner is referred to as a pension credit right. As the pension credit right will increase the ex-spouse’s existing pension rights this may affect or increase their liability to the lifetime allowance charge. The legislation provides that ex-spouses acquiring pension credit rights may be entitled to enhance their lifetime allowance to reduce or negate their liability.
PTM092200,PTM092200 Protecting Pre-April 2006 Pension Rights: Divorce,An ex-spouse may be able to claim a lifetime allowance enhancement provided certain conditions are met. How this is dealt with depends on whether the pension credit rights were acquired before or after 6 April 2006. This guidance only applies to pension credit rights acquired before 6 April 2006. For pension credit rights acquired on or after 6 April 2006 see PTM095200.

PTM092200,PTM092200 Protecting Pre-April 2006 Pension Rights: Divorce,Where pension credit rights were acquired before 6 April 2006 a lifetime enhancement factor known as “the pre-commencement pension credit factor” could be given providing an individual notified HMRC by 5 April 2009 of any pre-commencement pension credits the enhancement can be given to ensure parity of treatment with the previous tax regime.
PTM092200,PTM092200 Protecting Pre-April 2006 Pension Rights: Divorce,The enhancement to the lifetime allowance is the value of the pension credit (indexed) expressed as a factor of the standard lifetime allowance for the tax year 2006/07.

PTM092200,PTM092200 Protecting Pre-April 2006 Pension Rights: Divorce,IAPC is the amount of the pension credit awarded for the purposes of section 29(1) of Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 or Article 26(1) of Welfare Reform and Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 increased by the percentage increase in the retail price index (RPI) from the month in which the rights were acquired to April 2006.
PTM092200,PTM092200 Protecting Pre-April 2006 Pension Rights: Divorce,SLA is the standard lifetime allowance for the tax year 2006-07.
PTM092200,PTM092200 Protecting Pre-April 2006 Pension Rights: Divorce,"The factor should go to two decimal places. This should be a rounded-up figure, so for example if the calculation produces a factor of 0.231 this becomes 0.24."
PTM092200,PTM092200 Protecting Pre-April 2006 Pension Rights: Divorce,"For the avoidance of doubt, the only permitted indexation of the pension credit is by the RPI percentage increase - as described above. This applies even where the pension credit contains an element attributable to contracted out rights."

PTM092200,PTM092200 Protecting Pre-April 2006 Pension Rights: Divorce,"By applying the above formula to the standard lifetime allowance on 5 April 2006, it will be enhanced by a factor of 0.1 or 10 per cent (£150,000/£1.5 million)."
PTM092200,PTM092200 Protecting Pre-April 2006 Pension Rights: Divorce,"Provided an application was received by them before 6 April 2006, HMRC will have issued a certificate showing the enhancement to the standard lifetime allowance as a factor of 0.1."

PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"Applications for FP 2016 made before 6 April 2016 were invalid and were not processed by HMRC. Where a member has made an application that is invalid because it was made too early, they can resubmit their application at any time after 5 April 2016."
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"A member can apply for FP 2016 if they do not have any of fixed protection 2014 (FP 2014), fixed protection (FP 2012), primary protection or enhanced protection. They do not need to have already built up pension savings of more than £1.25 million to apply. As an application for FP 2016 can be made at any time, if another existing protection is lost, the member can then apply for FP 2016."
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"If someone wants to apply for FP 2016 then they will need to meet certain conditions. These are that, on 6 April 2016, they:"
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"were a member of a registered pension scheme or a relieved member of a relevant non-UK pension scheme (see PTM113410 for definitions of a ‘relieved member’ and a ‘relieved non-UK pension scheme’),"
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"did not have primary protection (see PTM092300 for more detail), did not have enhanced protection (see PTM092400 for more detail),"
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),did not have FP 2012 or FP 2014 (see PTM093000 for more detail)
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),did not have individual protection 2014 (IP 2014) - see PTM094000 for more detail.
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),Once a member is satisfied that they meet these conditions then they can apply to HMRC to get FP 2016 provided a protection-cessation event (see PTM093400) has not occurred.
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"Once, an individual has FP 2016 there are restrictions on what they are able to do with their future pension savings. For example, they will normally have needed to stop building up benefits under every registered pension scheme that they belong to by 5 April 2016."
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),Applications for FP 2016 must be made online
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),Paragraph 14(3)(b) and (c) Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),Applications for FP 2016 must be made online on or after 6 April 2016. See link below for more details.

PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),Paragraph 14(3)(a) Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),An application can be made by either the member themselves or some other person on their behalf.
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),Conditions required for a valid application for FP 2016
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),Paragraph 14(3) Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"An application for FP 2016 must be made online on or after 6 April 2016 (see above). For the online application to be valid, certain conditions have to be met. These conditions are that the application must:"
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"be made by or on behalf of the individual concerned,"
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"contain the individual’s title, full name, full postal address and e-mail address and, where the individual is not the applicant, contain the same details for the applicant as well"
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),give the individual’s date of birth
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"give the individual’s National Insurance number (or if they do not have a National Insurance number, give the reason for this),"
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"contain a declaration that the member meets the conditions for FP 2016 (see](#apply) 2016 {#} - introduction),"
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"contain a declaration that everything stated in the application is true and complete to the best of the applicant’s knowledge and belief,"
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"contain a declaration that the individual has met the conditions referred to in the introduction above, and"
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"contain a declaration that, in the period from 6 April 2016 to the date the application is made, no protection-cessation event (see PTM093400) has occurred in relation to the member."
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),There is no need to give any valuation of current or expected pension funds as part of the application.
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),Giving up enhanced protection
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),If a member has enhanced protection on 6 April 2016 then they cannot benefit from FP 2016.
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"Once a member has told HMRC that they plan to rely on enhanced protection they will have received a certificate with details of their protection. However, unlike primary protection a member can choose to give up enhanced protection."
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),If a member has enhanced protection only (without primary protection) then so long as they have given this up before 6 April 2016 they can apply for FP 2016.
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"If a member holds both primary and enhanced protection and they choose to give up enhanced protection, they will still have their primary protection. As a member cannot give up primary protection, this will stop them from benefitting from FP 2016."
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"If an individual wishes to give up enhanced protection they must tell HMRC in writing. The relevant legislation says that in such cases, enhanced protection ceases from the date HMRC receives this written notice. So enhanced protection cannot be given up from some future date. If a member wished to keep enhanced protection until 5 April 2016 they must have ensured that HMRC received their written notice on that date. Once an individual has given up enhanced protection they cannot change their mind. Enhanced protection cannot be re-instated. If a member gets FP 2016 by giving up enhanced protection and later finds they made the wrong decision they cannot get their enhanced protection back."
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),Will HMRC accept all applications for FP 2016?
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"Paragraphs 14(1), (2), (4), and 16 Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016"
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"As long as the member completes the prescribed form giving all the information that is requested then the application is a valid application which will be accepted by HMRC. Where HMRC refuse to accept an application, they must notify the member who has a right to appeal against that decision (see Appeal against HMRC’s refusal to issue or decision to withdraw a reference number)."
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),How will a member know if HMRC has accepted their application for FP 2016?
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),Paragraph 14(1) to (4) Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),When HMRC has received an application and accepted it as valid they will issue the member with a reference number unless the member already has IP 2014. This will be done online.
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"Where the member makes a valid application for FP 2016 but has already successfully applied for IP 2014, then their application is successful on a dormant basis. This is because IP 2014 protects pension savings with a value of between £1.25 millions and £1.5 million and so protects a greater amount of pension savings than FP 2016. This means that HMRC will not issue the member with a reference number unless and until the member’s IP 2014 no longer applies (see PTM094400 for when this happens). HMRC will notify the individual accordingly. If IP 2014 no longer applies, the member must inform HMRC of this whereupon HMRC will issue the FP 2016 reference number."
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),When HMRC may withdraw a FP 2016 reference number
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),Paragraph 15 Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),HMRC may withdraw a reference number that they have issued to a member if
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),something contained in the member’s application was incorrect there has been a protection-cessation event (see](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/pensions-tax-manual/ptm093400) for more detail) since their application was made
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),the member has failed to respond within the given deadline to a notice given by HMRC under paragraph 1 of Schedule 36 to Finance Act 2008 relating to the member and FP 2016.
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),If HMRC withdraws a member’s FP 2016 they must notify the member to tell them that they have done so and give their reasons for the withdrawal. The member may appeal against the withdrawal of their reference number.
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),Appeal against HMRC’s refusal to issue or decision to withdraw a FP 2016 reference number
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),Paragraph 16 Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"Where HMRC has refused to accept a member’s application for FP 2016, they must notify the member that their application has been unsuccessful. The member may appeal against this decision to the First-tier or Upper-tier Tribunal as appropriate. The member may similarly appeal against HMRC’s decision to withdraw their reference number."
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),The member must tell HMRC if they want to appeal against the refusal to issue a reference number or the withdrawal of their reference number and they must do this within 30 days of the date when the notification of refusal/withdrawal was given. An appeal cannot be made where the application has been successful on a dormant basis (see How will a member know if HMRC has accepted their application for FP 2016?).
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"Where the appeal is considered by the tribunal and relates to the refusal to issue a reference number, the tribunal will allow the appeal if the tribunal is satisfied that:"
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),the application was a valid application (see Conditions required for a valid application for FP 2016)
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"everything in the application was correct, and"
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"that, at the time of their decision, withdrawal of the requested reference number would not, had it been issued, be authorised either because a protection-cessation event has occurred or because the individual has failed to comply, within the required time, with a notice they have been given under Paragraph 1 of Schedule 36 to Finance Act 2008 to provide information or a document to HMRC to allow their tax position to be checked."
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),If the above grounds are not satisfied the tribunal must dismiss the appeal.
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),If the tribunal finds that HMRC should have accepted the notice then HMRC must issue the member with a FP 2016 reference number.
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"Where the appeal is considered by the tribunal and relates to the withdrawal of a reference number, the tribunal will allow the appeal if the tribunal is satisfied that the withdrawal was not authorised on the grounds set out at When HMRC may withdraw a reference number."
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),Notifying subsequent protection-cessation events
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),Paragraph 17 Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),An individual must notify HMRC if a protection-cessation event (see PTM093400) has occurred at a time when any of the following circumstances apply:
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"the individual has been issued with a reference number following a successful application for FP 2016,"
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"the individual has a pending application for a FP 2016 reference number. A pending application is one where either the individual has made an application but does not yet know if it has been successful (i.e. they have not been issued with a reference number) or the application has been unsuccessful but an appeal is in progress against HMRC’s refusal to issue a reference number (an appeal, including a further appeal, is in progress for so long as it has not been either withdrawn or determined and there is no prospect of further appeal, or"
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),an appeal is in progress against HMRC’s decision to withdraw the individual’s FP 2016 reference number.
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"Where any of the above circumstances apply, the individual must notify HMRC that the protection-cessation event has occurred. The notice must be given within 90 days of the day on which the individual could first reasonably be expected to have known that the event has occurred. The notice must be given either using the online facility provided by HMRC for this purpose or by any other means authorised by HMRC in a particular case."
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),What happens if the member dies before they have made an application for FP 2016?
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),Paragraph 19 Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"Where the member dies before making an application for FP 2016, their personal representatives (PRs) are able to do anything in relation to applying for FP 2014 that the member could have done."
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),So all of the above guidance applies to PRs in such circumstances. Where the application is being made by the member’s PRs there is a further condition for a valid application (see Conditions {#} required for a valid application for FP) namely that the application must contain the individual’s date of death as well as their date of birth.
PTM093210,PTM093210 Applying For Fixed Protection 2016 (FP 2016),"If, after the individual’s death, HMRC decides to withdraw a reference number issued to the individual (see When HMRC may withdraw a reference number) they must give the notice of, and reasons for, to the individual’s PRs."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,A pension scheme’s rules may include an earnings cap. This means that the pension scheme’s definition of final pensionable salary includes a cap on the amount of a member’s earnings that counts as pensionable salary. The cap may change with the tax year (for example the continued operation of the earnings cap under pre 6 April 2006 tax legislation).
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"Where a member has applied for one of the fixed protections and their pension scheme’s rules include an earnings cap, an increase in the cap will lead to the loss of the fixed protection where this results in benefit accrual."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,Example
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,James is a member of a registered pension scheme. The scheme provides a pension benefit (before commutation for a pension commencement lump sum) of 1/60th of pensionable earnings for each year of service.
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"The scheme’s rules contain an earnings cap which increases every 6 April by an amount equal to the annual increase in the RPI for the year ending with the preceding month of September, rounded up to the nearest multiple of £600."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"On 6 April 2013 the scheme’s cap is £150,000."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"For tax year 2013-14, James has earnings of £200,000."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"On 5 April 2014 James has completed exactly 30 years of pensionable service. James has therefore accrued a pension of £75,000 (£150,000 x 30/60). That is also the amount he has accrued immediately after midnight on 5 April 2014."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"For FP 2014 purposes James’s pension rights are valued at £1.25 million (£75,000 x 20 = £1.5 million) and James has successfully applied for FP 2014."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,The annual increase in the RPI between September 2012 and September 2013 is say 5.6%.
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"On 6 April 2014 the scheme’s earnings cap increases to £158,400 (£150,000 @ 105.6/100 = £158,400. There is no rounding up as £8400 is an exact multiple of £600)."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,James has remained in active membership of his scheme; under the scheme’s rules his benefits are increased by reference to his length of service and final salary (subject to the earnings cap) rather than by a percentage specified in the scheme’s rules.
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"For the purposes of the benefit accrual test, the relevant percentage (see](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/pensions-tax-manual/ptm093600) for more detail) in James’s case is the higher of the appropriate CPI percentage increase and the relevant statutory increase percentage. The CPU percentage increase is the 5.2% increase (say) in the CPI between September 2012 and September 2013. This is higher than any relevant statutory increase percentage that may apply to James’s benefit. So, in James’s case, the relevant percentage for tax year 2014-15 is 5.2%."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,This is less than the 5.6 % increase in James’s rights as a result of the increase in the earnings cap.
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,Benefit accrual has therefore occurred on 6 April 2014 and James loses his FP 2014 from that date.
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,The benefit accrual test for defined benefits in a tax year during which the member takes their benefits
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"When a member takes defined benefits in a tax year, whether or not there is benefit accrual at any time is calculated on the basis of their prospective benefits."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"The test is carried out on any increase(s) in the value of the member’s prospective pension and lump sum rights occurring throughout the year, ending with the point in time immediately before the BCE(s) occur(s) in relation to the benefits taken."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"In the case of an active member whose benefits accrue on the basis of final salary and years of service, since this does not involve increasing the rights of active members by a rate specified in the scheme’s rules, the ’relevant percentage’ (see](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/pensions-tax-manual/ptm093600) for more detail) will be the appropriate annual increase in the CPI unless a higher relevant statutory increase percentage applies in which case that higher percentage is the relevant percentage."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,If on this basis benefit accrual does occur at some time during the tax year before benefits are taken then the fixed protection is lost at the point the relevant percentage is exceeded.
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"If, later in the same tax year, those benefits are taken early and are subject to an actuarial reduction, then even though the value of the benefits taken may at that stage be less than the value of those benefits when they were calculated under the benefit accrual test, this does not alter the position and the fixed protection remains lost."

PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,Death-in-service benefit for members with fixed protection who ceases to accrue any further pension benefits in their employer’s defined benefits scheme
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,Under the tax rules it is possible for death-in-service benefits to be provided for individuals with deferred pension benefits. However a pension scheme may choose not to provide death in service benefits if a member stops being an active member. This will depend on the rules of the scheme.
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,Whether or not an individual can continue to have death benefits (life cover) and keep their fixed protection depends on the type of arrangement providing the death benefits. If the death benefit promised is a defined benefit (and this is often the case in occupational pension schemes) continuing to provide death cover should not cause loss of the fixed protection. This is because a death-in-service benefit is not considered to be part of a member’s defined benefit pension rights. So if a member continues to be provided with death-in-service defined benefits this is not benefit accrual and does not cause loss of the fixed protection.
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"If the death benefit promised is on the basis of an other (i.e. non-cash balance) money purchase benefit, cover may only continue with the member keeping their fixed protection if it is provided by a policy established before 6 April 2006. The conditions at PTM093100 must be met. Fixed protection is lost where contributions are made to a policy set up on or after 6 April 2006."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,Top of page
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,The consequences where a scheme insures against lump sum death benefits and continues payment of premiums for a member with any of the fixed protections
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"If the death benefit promised is on the basis of an other (i.e. non-cash balance) money purchase benefit, cover may only continue with the member keeping their fixed protection if it is provided by a policy established before 6 April 2006. The conditions at PTM093100 must be met. Fixed protection is lost where contributions are made to a policy set up on or after 6 April 2006."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"Where the only lump sum death benefit being provided under an arrangement under the scheme rules is an amount equivalent to the proceeds of an insurance policy, in other words, there is no provision for a defined benefits lump sum death benefit, then the arrangement is clearly an other money purchase arrangement."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,Where the lump sum death benefit is expressed as being the greater or lesser of:
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"a defined benefit (an amount determined by reference to salary, service or some other factor) and"

PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,Benefit accrual occurs in relation to both an other money purchase arrangement and a hybrid arrangement capable of paying such money purchase benefits where a relevant contribution is paid under the arrangement on or after:

PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"In each case, the payment of insurance premiums on or after the relevant dates result in benefit accrual and loss of fixed protection if the premium is a ‘relevant contribution’ as defined by paragraph 14 of Schedule 36 to Finance Act 2004 by virtue of paragraph 14(11) of Schedule 18 Finance Act 2011 for FP 2012, paragraph 1(10) of Schedule 22 to Finance Act 2013 for FP 2014 and paragraph 3(4) of Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016 for FP 2016."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"However, there are a number of other scenarios in which insured lump sum death benefits may be paid. Where the death benefit being paid is not a money purchase benefit that is not cash balance, continuing payment of premiums after 5 April 2012, 5 April 2014 or 5 April 2016 as appropriate will not be benefit accrual and so the fixed protection is not lost. The following are examples of scenarios where there is no benefit accrual if insurance premiums continue to be paid."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"Note: For the purpose of these examples, the defined benefits lump sum death benefit to be provided is assumed to be a lump sum of 4 times final salary. In practice, the defined benefit may be different (such as a specified sum or by reference to a different multiple of salary), and any increase in the value of defined benefit after 5 April 2012, 5 April 2014 or 5 April 2016 as appropriate is not benefit accrual."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,Examples
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,A lump sum death benefit of 4 times final salary is paid out of scheme funds. This benefit is a defined benefits lump sum death benefit.
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"A lump sum death benefit is backed by an insurance policy where, if the policy proceeds exceed the promised lump sum death benefit, the excess is paid to the scheme for the provision of other benefits under the scheme."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,A lump sum death benefit is backed by an insurance policy with the scheme liable to make good any shortfall where the proceeds of the policy are insufficient to fully fund the cost of the promised lump sum death benefit.
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"A lump sum death benefit is calculated as above and is backed by an insurance policy which will not pay out more than the promised lump sum death benefit but may contain restrictions. These restrictions, if applicable, will result in an amount payable to the scheme (or payable directly to the beneficiary(ies) which is less than the unrestricted promised defined benefits lump sum death benefit."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,Many insurance policies contain such restrictions as terms of the policy. Examples include when there is a ‘catastrophe’ event resulting in multiple deaths of individuals covered by the policy or a reference to a particular individual who represents a greater insurance risk. If the lump sum death benefit paid to the beneficiaries after the restriction is applied can itself be expressed as a defined benefits lump sum death benefit then it will be treated as such. This can occur where the benefit
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,represents a percentage of the defined benefits lump sum death benefit that would have been provided in normal circumstances.
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,it is paid on a pro rata basis to the defined benefits lump sum death benefit that would have been provided in normal circumstances
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"it is expressed as a specified amount lower than 4 times final salary, or"
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,the maximum paid under the policy is capped at a specified amount.
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"The exact position will depend upon the restrictions that apply under a particular policy. Provided the maximum lump sum death benefit that can be provided under the policy is the defined benefits lump sum death benefit of 4 times final salary and the restricted lump sum death benefit is defined in a manner which satisfies either the definition of defined benefits or, possibly, a benefit under a cash balance arrangement there will be no other money purchase element to the benefits to be provided. Where, under a group life policy, there are restrictions applying to one or more particular members covered by the policy but they do not apply to a member with fixed protection, then no account need be taken of those restrictions in deciding whether that member’s benefit is a defined benefits lump sum death benefit."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"An individual has restricted benefits under one policy but a further policy is taken out by the scheme in respect of the individual to ensure that the maximum 4 times final salary lump sum death benefit is paid. The aggregated benefits under the two policies will be a defined benefits lump sum death benefit, subject to the top-up policy not itself being an other money purchase arrangement because the entire proceeds will be paid out as a lump sum death benefit."
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"The insurance policy might, for example, make provision for a maximum dependants’ pension equal to 30 per cent of the member’s salary, but with the pension restricted to the ‘free-cover’ divided by a specified multiple (say 30). So, if the free-cover is £500,000, the maximum dependant’s pension is £16,667. This is a defined benefit, as a specified benefit (a pension) will be provided and that pension is calculated by reference to a factor, rather than just the amount available for the provision of dependants’ benefits."

PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,Under scheme rules a lump sum death benefit may include an amount equal to a multiple of salary or a set monetary amount together with a refund of the contributions paid to the scheme by the deceased member.
PTM093520,PTM093520 Defined Benefits Arrangements - Aspects Of ‘Benefit Accrual’,"HMRC’s view is that the payment of a refund of contributions on death is a defined benefit and that the aggregate lump sum is a defined benefits lump sum death benefit. Where the rules also provide for the refund to include an element of ‘interest’ or growth to be paid, then provided that the scheme rules provide for the payment and it is expressed or can be expressed in percentage terms then this will not affect the defined benefits nature of the lump sum. The scheme rules may specify an annual percentage rate of ‘interest’ or a rate in line with the average annual base rate of a bank etc. or a rate to be determined by the scheme trustees in accordance with actuarial advice. Such rules are accepted as providing a defined benefit."
PTM094310,PTM094310 Valuing Pension Savings For Individual Protection 2016,The lifetime allowance provisions apply only to that part of the scheme that has befitted from UK tax relief. This is known as the ‘relevant relieved amount’. At any BCE under a relieved non-UK pension scheme’ the amount crystallised by the BCE is limited to the ‘untested portion’ of the ‘relevant relieved amount’. PTM113420 explains how to calculate the ‘relevant relieved amount’ and the ‘untested portion’. But in broad terms the untested portion is that part of the member’s relevant relieved amount that has not been subject to a BCE.
PTM094310,PTM094310 Valuing Pension Savings For Individual Protection 2016,To find amount D assume that a BCE occurs at the end of 5 April 2016 for uncrystallised rights held under a relieved non-UK pension scheme. Amount D is the untested portion for this assumed BCE. Where the member has more than one relieved non-UK pension scheme amount D is the total of the untested portions.

An example of this would be work done to comply with fire safety requirements of a fire authority. However this does not extend to work that is undertaken to satisfy such regulations as part of a wider scheme of improvement of the property.
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,In the case of an investment-regulated pension scheme that before 6 April 2006 was a self-invested personal pension (SIPP) or a small self-administered scheme (SSAS) improvement work on a property that was held indirectly at 6 April 2006 will lose protection if that work was begun on or after 5 December 2005. If that work is not substantially completed until on or after 6 April 2006 then the property will become taxable property when it is substantially completed. If the work was substantially completed before 6 April 2006 it will become taxable property at that date. In either case the amount of the unauthorised payment is the market value on that date. This value is also taken as the acquisition cost for any capital gains calculation that is made in order to determine the amount of the scheme chargeable payment when the property is disposed of.

PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,Extension of transitional protection for indirect holdings
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,There is transitional protection where a pension scheme legitimately held indirect interests at 6 April 2006 and the indirect vehicle after that date acquires interests in taxable property. There are different conditions for residential property and tangible moveable property.
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,An example of these indirect interests is an investment-regulated pension scheme that before 6 April 2006 was a Small Self-Administered Scheme (SSAS) was permitted to invest in shares of any unquoted company up to a limit of 30% of the voting power or 30% of the dividend rights.
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,The six conditions for transitional protection to apply in respect of residential property are:
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,the pension scheme acquired the interest in the vehicle that it holds on 6 April 2006 before that date
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,the pension scheme was not prohibited from holding the interest in the vehicle before 6 April 2006
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,immediately before 6 April 2006 the vehicle had a residential property rental business and held five or more residential properties for that rental business
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,"between 6 April 2006 and the date when the vehicle acquires a direct interest in residential property, the pension scheme never holds an interest in the vehicle that it would have been prohibited from holding if it had held that interest immediately before 6 April 2006"

PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,The four conditions for transitional protection to apply in respect of tangible moveable property are:
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,the pension scheme acquired before 6 April 2006 the interest in the vehicle that it holds on that date
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,the pension scheme was not immediately before 6 April 2006 prohibited from holding that interest in the vehicle

PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,Most of the transitional protection rules were set out in a technical note issued on the day of the 2005 pre-budget report (PBR) (5th December 2005). The table below sets out the announcement that was made at that time and sets out the transitional provisions by reference to different scheme types.

PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,There will be no protection for any off-plan purchases made after PBR Day.
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,"Where a property was purchased by a SSAS under the pre 1991 rules the investment will be protected, provided it is not materially improved (unless for a statutory requirement) after midnight on PBR day. There will be no protection if there is any post-PBR material improvement expenditure (unless for a statutory requirement)."
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,There will be no protection if the indirect investment is not allowed under the current regime.
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,No protection for any investments in residential property made by small mandatory approved schemes set up and approved after midnight on PBR day.
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,in the table PBR means 5 December 2005

PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,"In the table above, a purchase is regarded as having been made where:"
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,"both exchange of contracts and completion; or conclusion of unconditional missives and the settlement of the transaction, has taken place before the appropriate time (the appropriate time will, depending on the context, be either midnight on PBR day or midnight on 5 April 2006)"
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,"exchange of contracts or conclusion of unconditional missives takes place before the appropriate time, or"
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,there is some other binding obligation to purchase before the appropriate time.

PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,A purchase will not be regarded as having been made at the appropriate time where:
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,"exchange of contracts or conclusion of unconditional missives takes place after the appropriate time, or"
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,"the scheme is not legally bound to purchase prior to the appropriate time so, for example, the purchase of an option to buy property would not count."
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,Improvement expenditure is regarded as having been made before an appropriate time where:
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,"the scheme has, before that time, entered into a binding contract for the work to be carried out, or"
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,"the work is not subject to a binding contract, but, before that time, a substantial amount of the works have been carried out."
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,Where a SIPP had acquired a property - for example off-plan - with the intention of holding it as an investment but as a result of the taxable property changes announced at the 2005 pre-budget report the decision was taken to dispose of that property it is not axiomatic that this disposal would be classified as “trading”. Each situation is decided on its own particular facts and general guidance regarding the approach to be taken in determining whether a transaction is to be regarded as trading or investment can be found in the Business Income Manual from BIM60000 onwards.
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,"But if the asset was acquired with the intention to hold as an investment (See BIM60030) and was disposed of following the taxable property changes, unless there has been a change of intention (of the type discussed in BIM60060) normally resulting in some form of physical change to the asset, this transaction is unlikely to be regarded as a trading one."
PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,"In the case of off-plan, the fact that it was in the process of being developed at 5 December 2005 in accordance with the contract originally entered into between the developer and the SIPP, would not make it a trading transaction for the SIPP where the development continues."
