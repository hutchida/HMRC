Without special provision, the company may not get relief under the loan relationships legislation.",This guidance covers cases in which interest is capitalised in a company’s financial statements and therefore does not immediately give rise to amounts recognised as items of profit or loss. S 320 allows amounts to be taken into account for tax notwithstanding this treatment. This section was amended by F(No.2)A15 for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"CTA09/S320 applies where, in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice, amounts arising on a loan relationship are taken into account in determining the value of a fixed capital asset or project. Despite that treatment, the credit or debit must be brought into account under the loan relationships rules. This treatment is mandatory.","It should be noted, however, that there was no major changes to the general effect of the provision. The main change is that the special rule is no longer limited to amounts taken to the carrying value of a ‘fixed capital asset or project’, terminology not current in UK GAAP."

CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,Development costs,"There are, however, situations where amounts are recognised in determining the carrying value of an asset or liability, and a result this does not give rise to an amount recognised as an item or profit or loss unless and until the asset is amortised or derecognised. Without special provision, the company may not get relief under the loan relationships legislation."
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"This treatment also applies where development costs, for example in the development phase of a new product, are capitalised. If the development costs are correctly treated as a fixed capital asset, the company will get relief for interest and other associated cost when they are incurred.","S320 operates to address this. This provision applies where, in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice, amounts are recognised in determining the carrying value of certain assets or liabilities. Despite that treatment, the amounts must be brought into account under the loan relationships rules. This treatment is mandatory."
CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,Work in progress,"This does not mean that any debit or credit in a company’s accounts will automatically give rise to tax relief or a tax charge.

CFM33160,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,CFM33160 GAAP: Amounts Taken To Carrying Value Of An Asset Or Liability,"Work in progress of, for example, a property developer, is not a fixed capital asset or project. Work in progress features in the profit and loss account in the form of stock. It is circulating capital and not a fixed asset of the company (see the Business Income Manual BIM35000+ on the distinction between fixed and circulating capital). Interest payable will be a debit in the profit and loss account but counterbalanced by an increase in work in progress. This does not mean that the interest has not been effectively debited to the profit and loss account. No adjustment will therefore be needed to ensure that relief is given for interest paid and taken to work in progress.",S320 can therefore operate to bring forward the point at which the amounts are recognised under the loan relationship rules.

This will result in an allowable loss on the disposal of the right to receive unascertainable deferred consideration - the `notional security’ for TCGA92/S138A, see the example in CG58095. A loss arising in a later year may not be carried back to set against gains of an earlier year (except on death, see [CG30430](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-gains-manual/cg30430)+)."

This is because part of the main policy falls within the legal definition of travel risks and the travel add-on will contain two or more of the travel components. Normally the policy should be apportioned between the travel elements of the policy at the higher rate (in this case, the incidental travel element of the main policy plus the travel add-on) and non- travel risks at the standard rate. However, to ease the administrative burden on insurers it will only be necessary to apply the higher rate to that part of the premium relating to the travel add-ons.","Most parts of a premium relating to incidental travel risks in individual private medical, personal accident or household (as well as other) policies would normally fall within the de minimis limits.

Therefore the *de minimis *rules would not apply and the premium would have to be apportioned.

However, as explained immediately above, where a broker receives a premium on behalf of an insurer using the cash receipt scheme and the broker subsequently fails to pay that premium to the insurer, the insurer is still required to account for the tax.",Bad debt relief under the basic cash receipt scheme

Thus policing the transitional arrangements and making sure there is no abuse is very much down to the discretion of local officers and your knowledge of your insurer.

OT03010,OT03010 PRT - Introduction,OT03010 PRT: Overview Of PRT - Introduction,"Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) was introduced by OTA75. It is essentially a tax on the profits from oil and gas production from the UK Continental Shelf. Unlike Corporation Tax, which is charged on the aggregate profit arising from all oil fields owned by a company, PRT is charged on each owner’s share of the profits of each individual oil field. PRT profit and losses are therefore calculated using the statutory procedure set out in OTA75 rather than by reference to profits shown in company accounts. The scope of PRT was significantly amended by OTA83 to reflect the more complex infrastructure arrangements which had developed by that date. Tariff and disposal receipts arising from the use of field assets were brought directly into charge and the provisions for apportioning expenditure between fields were altered. PRT was abolished on 16 March 1993 for all fields given development consent on or after that date. The current rate of PRT is 50%.","Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) was introduced by OTA75.

Also the seller needs to know how much oil he is likely to need to sell in the month. The terms of oil sales spot contracts (both forward and dated) reflect the purchaser’s information requirements.

This is based on the evidence of deals done FOB and CIF in recent history for delivery in the relevant month with other factors being taken into account such as any abnormal qualify cargoes, distressed buyers or sellers in any of the past transactions, timing of deliveries and, if relevant, relative values from other markets from which product might be imported or to which product might be exported.

Where a number of cargoes have been sold into more or less “standard” ports such as Rotterdam, Teeside etc. then it may be easier to arrive at a general assessment of the CIF price and then deduct an assessment of the typical freight cost that would be incurred between North Sea terminals and those ports. This assessment tends to be based on term freight contracts rather than the spot rates, and the FOB-CIF differential thus tends to move more or less in line with the long terms freight market. The graphs attached show that between 1990 and 1993, the CIF-FOB differential has narrowed substantially reflecting a steady weakening in time charter rates for LPG tankers.","In addition, the limited nature of LPG storage means that it is much more difficult for individual owners to accumulate production over a period of months in order to lift a viable parcel than is the case on crude oil.

Similarly the reconciliation may include amounts described as unclaimed amounts. These may constitute over claims. And accounts expenditure may need to be increased in the course of the reconciliation by various adjustments to make the figures reconcile. Inspectors will need to consider such adjustments critically. It would help the process of reconciliation and the examination of claims if companies would, when making claims, always specifically identify and give the reasons for negative items of expenditure included within claims.",The reconciliation should be designed to tie the expenditure in the accounts which has already been analysed on a field by field basis back to identified expenditure claims under Schedule 5 and Schedule 6. There should also be a full reconciliation of exploration expenditure and any research and development as analysed in the accounts and computations back to the Schedule 7 claims. The analysis of claims should identify the claim numbers agreed with the OTO and if that information is not available the date of the claim.
OT19140,OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),It will be necessary to analyse the turnover in the accounts between arm’s length and non arm’s length sales in order to agree adjustments under S493. If this analysis is provided before final agreement of valuation issues has taken place it is possible that they may be changes in the designation of sales from arm’s length to non arm’s length. It may be necessary therefore to check that the analysis is agreed. Errors in this area are likely to operate against the taxpayer’s interest.,"The reconciliation should identify unclaimable expenditure in particular terms such as interest, depreciation, onshore exploration and buildings. Expenditure on exempt gas fields also needs to be separately identified. This is necessary so that it can be seen that none of this expenditure has unwittingly franked claims that have been made. Inspectors should look for negative amounts in this expenditure analysis as these may indicate receipts which have been ignored for PRT purposes."
OT19140,OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),"In certain circumstances, the OTO will agree to examine ‘informal’ claims, particularly those relating to Schedule 7 expenditure. This procedure enables a company to submit details of allowable expenditure without, in the case of Schedule 7 claims, specifying the field of claim or period for allowance until a formal claim is submitted. The procedure operates on the basis that the same care is required for an informal as for a formal claim, and that the latter must specify the exact items being claimed from any formal ‘pool’. The reconciliation should be to the informal claim, which will normally be based on accounting periods. Where subsequent formal claims have been made they will already be reconciled to the informal claim.",If the reconciliation reveals over claims they should be explicitly identified when the reconciliation is presented to OTO. (See also Examination of the Reconciliations below).
OT19140,OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),Examination of the Reconciliations,"There will be a residue of expenditure which is in principle claimable for PRT purposes but has not yet been claimed. This will relate to fields under development, and similar prospects and also unutilised exploration expenditure where the taxpayer has no need of Schedule 7 claims. It is important that this expenditure is analysed to the extent that is possible when the reconciliation is prepared. This will enable future claims to be checked against this analysis and avoid a further reconciliation. It will be useful if an ongoing memorandum of unclaimed amounts is submitted each year with the reconciliation for the latest year showing the unclaimed amounts of earlier years updated by claims made since the previous reconciliation."
OT19140,OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),The fact that reconciliations have been received in OTO should be taken into account by each Inspector with PRT responsibilities for the taxpayer and for each field in which the company is a participator in examining claims.,OTO does not recognise as a general principle that there may be a setting off of over claims against “under claims”. Companies are not obliged to claim expenditure and OTO cannot be involved in considering whether an “under claim” arose as a result of deliberate policy or as a result of error. In considering culpability in relation to over claims OTO will not as a matter of principle accept the offsetting of over claims with “under claims” but a flexible approach will be taken in setting particular cases and regard will always be had to all of the circumstances and the merits of the particular case before forming a view on culpability.
OT19140,OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),It is expected that the first reconciliations that are received from any company will need the most careful examination. Inspectors will need to satisfy themselves that the reconciliation has been competently performed and that all matters that need to be considered have been considered. It will be necessary for the Inspector to inform himself as to the detailed way in which the reconciliation has been completed and presented. Provided the method of doing the reconciliation remains consistent it is to be anticipated that future reconciliations will be agreed more readily. The greatest value in reconciliations will therefore have been achieved by the time the reconciliation is completed. By that time companies will probably have made any further claims that they feel they ought to have made and they will have notified OTO individually of over claims as they have been identified.,"Where the company is not the operator for a field it will probably have unrecognisable differences because of differences in exchange rate policies and accruals. The resolution of such problems will be dealt with on a case by case basis. Inspectors will need to consider carefully explanations put forward and exercise judgement in reaching agreement with companies. Similarly the reconciliation may include amounts described as unclaimed amounts. These may constitute over claims. And accounts expenditure may need to be increased in the course of the reconciliation by various adjustments to make the figures reconcile. Inspectors will need to consider such adjustments critically. It would help the process of reconciliation and the examination of claims if companies would, when making claims, always specifically identify and give the reasons for negative items of expenditure included within claims."
OT19140,OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),"Paragraph 9 Schedule 2 OTA 1975 provides that where any return statement, declaration or accounts as are mentioned in Paragraph 8 Schedule 2 were made or submitted by any person neither fraudulently nor negligently and it comes to his notice those were incorrect then, unless the error is remedied without unreasonable delay, the return statement, declaration or account shall be treated as having been negligently made or submitted by the first mentioned person. It is important therefore that as companies discover errors or over claims in the course of performing the reconciliations they bring them to OTO’s attention immediately without waiting for completion of the reconciliation. This will ensure that in cases where the original error was not one arising from negligence that Para 9 does not operate to treat it as such.",It will be necessary to analyse the turnover in the accounts between arm’s length and non arm’s length sales in order to agree adjustments under S493.

OT19140,OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),"It is accepted that a totally balanced reconciliation will often prove difficult to achieve. Whatever method a company uses most exercises will finish with an unexplained difference. As far as seems reasonable, having regard to the amount of the difference both in absolute terms and in relation to total expenditure, the company should endeavour to establish the reason or likely reason for the difference. In the final analysis it is a matter for judgement at what point and level an unexplained difference should be accepted. Clearly a difference representing excess PRT claimed expenditure over CT expenditure gives OTO more cause for concern than the reverse situation. It is in fact more likely on the evidence of completed reconciliations seen that the company will uncover PRT claimable but unclaimed expenditure as a result of the exercise. Additional expenditure claims submitted in these circumstances will be subjected to careful examination. Where for time limit reasons such an additional claim is submitted before submission and examination of the reconciliation concerned, examination of the PRT claim may need to be deferred until the reconciliation is submitted and examined.",Top of page
OT19140,OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),OT19140 PRT: Appendices - PRT/Accounts Reconciliation (Full Version),When further claims are made as a result of a reconciliation it is not enough for a company to identify the existence of unclaimed amounts. There may have been good reason for not claiming the expenditure.

However a pension scheme may choose not to provide death in service benefits if a member stops being an active member. This will depend on the rules of the scheme.,"The scheme’s rules contain an earnings cap which increases every 6 April by an amount equal to the annual increase in the RPI for the year ending with the preceding month of September, rounded up to the nearest multiple of £600."

If the death benefit promised is a defined benefit (and this is often the case in occupational pension schemes) continuing to provide death cover should not cause loss of the fixed protection. This is because a death-in-service benefit is not considered to be part of a member’s defined benefit pension rights. So if a member continues to be provided with death-in-service defined benefits this is not benefit accrual and does not cause loss of the fixed protection.,"On 6 April 2013 the scheme’s cap is £150,000."

PTM125500,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,PTM125500 Pre A-Day Investments,there is some other binding obligation to purchase before the appropriate time.,Some pension schemes entered into arrangements to acquire interests in residential property where the interest would not actually be acquired until 6 April 2006 or later. These are commonly known as “off-plan purchases” and were permitted where they did not constitute the holding of residential property as it was defined under the pre 6 April 2006 rules. If the “off-plan purchases” are cancelled or disposed of without the interest in residential property being acquired by the pension scheme there will be no taxable property charges. This is because the pension scheme never acquires taxable property. See the second paragraph under ‘Summary’ below for information about the trading position for off plan purchases that were in the course of development at 5 December 2005.
