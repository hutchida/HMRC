      <td>IPT07300 Bad Debt Relief</td>
      <td>Where an insurer uses the cash receipt method and deals directly with the insured (i.e. payment is not made through a broker) there is effectively automatic bad debt relief: no receipt of cash by the insurer means there is no tax point and thus no requirement to account for tax. However, as explained immediately above, where a broker receives a premium on behalf of an insurer using the cash receipt scheme and the broker subsequently fails to pay that premium to the insurer, the insurer is still required to account for the tax.</td>

      <td>An additional premium subject to the new rate of IPT will have the same potential effect on a de minimis policy as would any other additional premium (see IPT07670). A particular problem will only arise if an additional premium, liable to tax at the new rate, causes a premium, previously treated as exempt under the de minimis arrangements, to become taxable. In these circumstances tax on the original premium (due at the old rate) becomes due on the date that the original premium was written, although it is acceptable for the insurer to account for IPT at the old rate on the original premium on the date that he writes the additional premium.</td>

Businesses seek to reduce their costs and their exposure to tax by structuring and organising their affairs to minimise legitimately the amount of tax to which they are liable. This process requires a close attention to the law dealing with the relevant taxes. The Department deals with advisers whose first resort is to the law. To deal with this you have to be familiar with the IPT law contained in the relevant Finance Acts, the IPT Regulations, and the Financial Services and Markets Act.

      <td>Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) was introduced by OTA75. It is essentially a tax on the profits from oil and gas production from the UK Continental Shelf. Unlike Corporation Tax, which is charged on the aggregate profit arising from all oil fields owned by a company, PRT is charged on each owner’s share of the profits of each individual oil field. PRT profit and losses are therefore calculated using the statutory procedure set out in OTA75 rather than by reference to profits shown in company accounts. The scope of PRT was significantly amended by OTA83 to reflect the more complex infrastructure arrangements which had developed by that date. Tariff and disposal receipts arising from the use of field assets were brought directly into charge and the provisions for apportioning expenditure between fields were altered. PRT was abolished on 16 March 1993 for all fields given development consent on or after that date. The current rate of PRT is 50%.</td>

      <td>When considering informal research claims it is essential to ensure that all of the conditions of OTA75\S5B are satisfied including the condition in OTA75\S5B(1)(b) which entails a three-year wait, see OT14125. OTA75\S5B was introduced to allow relief for expenditure failing to qualify for relief altogether (see OT14100), not to create a more general opportunity to make claims for relief outside a field for which expenditure might in due course become allowable under existing field-based rules. A three-year period from the time expenditure was incurred was considered a reasonable time to allow to elapse in order to establish field-linkage. The OTA75\S5B(1)(b) test is one which has to be applied at or after a particular time. It cannot be anticipated. Even though beforehand there may be a reasonable degree of certainty that expenditure will qualify, this is not enough to satisfy the provisions and the declaration which a claimant is required to make in presenting a claim.</td>

Originally this difference was mainly due to the fact that UK oil production profits were subject to PRT (on production from pre-1993 fields) whereas trading profits were not, although there were also instances where a company was not CT paying outside the ring-fence due to group relief etc. The introduction of the Supplementary Charge (SC) on production profits in 2002 (originally at 10% increased to 20% from 01 January 2006) meant that there was a differential tax rate between production and trading profits in all circumstances even where the production was derived from non-PRT post-1993 fields, this gave a further incentive to transfer value outside the ring-fence if possible.</td>

This may be in situations where it is accepted that there is little likelihood of there being any tax payable in respect of the field, in situations where expiry of time limits is not likely to be a factor because the periods terminate before the first claim period for any affected field ends, and in circumstances where the expenditure is clearly seen to be in a period where the field is pre-pay back. It will still be necessary to have a more detailed year by year analysis and consideration of accruals around the period at which a field approaches pay back. Because Sch 7 claims are always intended to be tax effective it will be necessary to reconcile them on an annual basis.</td>

In the final analysis it is a matter for judgement at what point and level an unexplained difference should be accepted. Clearly a difference representing excess PRT claimed expenditure over CT expenditure gives OTO more cause for concern than the reverse situation. It is in fact more likely on the evidence of completed reconciliations seen that the company will uncover PRT claimable but unclaimed expenditure as a result of the exercise. Additional expenditure claims submitted in these circumstances will be subjected to careful examination.

In that case, S320 does not apply and the accounts are simply followed.</td>

      <td>An insurer providing the Class 18 motor breakdown insurance is providing insurance to the primary insurer (see c. in IPT08480). The primary insurer undertakes to ensure that the breakdown service is provided to the policyholder in certain circumstances. The primary insurer becomes liable to pay for the breakdown services, and he lays off the cost of this to a second insurer for a premium of £15 per policyholder. The second insurer procures the breakdown services in order to meet his obligations under the insurance contract with the primary insurer. The insurance premium paid by the direct insurer to the secondary insurer is subject to IPT, as is the premium paid by the policyholder to the primary insurer.</td>

It will be necessary for the Inspector to inform himself as to the detailed way in which the reconciliation has been completed and presented. Provided the method of doing the reconciliation remains consistent it is to be anticipated that future reconciliations will be agreed more readily. The greatest value in reconciliations will therefore have been achieved by the time the reconciliation is completed.

As far as seems reasonable, having regard to the amount of the difference both in absolute terms and in relation to total expenditure, the company should endeavour to establish the reason or likely reason for the difference. In the final analysis it is a matter for judgement at what point and level an unexplained difference should be accepted. Clearly a difference representing excess PRT claimed expenditure over CT expenditure gives OTO more cause for concern than the reverse situation. It is in fact more likely on the evidence of completed reconciliations seen that the company will uncover PRT claimable but unclaimed expenditure as a result of the exercise. Additional expenditure claims submitted in these circumstances will be subjected to careful examination. Where for time limit reasons such an additional claim is submitted before submission and examination of the reconciliation concerned, examination of the PRT claim may need to be deferred until the reconciliation is submitted and examined.</td>

It does not matter whether each part of the benefits relating to the ‘normal pension age 60’ and ‘normal pension age 65’ are all in the same arrangements or different ones (unless there are differences arising from negative values, as explained in Before reaching first split normal pension age section above).

But taxpayers and practitioners are entitled to send in additional material if they consider that it adds information of relevance to the tax liability that cannot be contained within the return. We accept any additional information sent in with the return. So you should not send the deed back. Retain it and treat it as part of the return. If there is no normal compliance reason to enquire into the return, do not look at the deed, but if you open an enquiry at any time you may use it. You do not need to write to the taxpayer or agent, unless the document is an original, in which case see TSEM1710.</td>
