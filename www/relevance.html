Where however deferral is requested for more than one period OTO will normally need to see production and cash flow forecasts for the field covering the whole period from which deferral is sought. These should include the oil price assumption [and some oil price sensitivities], details of other assumptions such as the apportionment of expenditure and the $:£ exchange rate.

For example where a request is for a short term deferral of the return for a single period a simple PRT computation showing that gross income is covered by losses brought forward or oil allowance etc will be sufficient. Where however deferral is requested for more than one period OTO will normally need to see production and cash flow forecasts for the field covering the whole period from which deferral is sought. These should include the oil price assumption [and some oil price sensitivities], details of other assumptions such as the apportionment of expenditure and the $:£ exchange rate. PRT computations based on the projected figures should also be supplied [oil allowance utilisation should be stated in tonnes as well as the cash equivalent]. OTO will be happy to discuss the information required in respect of specific fields with individual companies.</td>

In the final analysis it is a matter for judgement at what point and level an unexplained difference should be accepted. Clearly a difference representing excess PRT claimed expenditure over CT expenditure gives OTO more cause for concern than the reverse situation. It is in fact more likely on the evidence of completed reconciliations seen that the company will uncover PRT claimable but unclaimed expenditure as a result of the exercise. Additional expenditure claims submitted in these circumstances will be subjected to careful examination.
