The primary insurer undertakes to ensure that the breakdown service is provided to the policyholder in certain circumstances. The primary insurer becomes liable to pay for the breakdown services, and he lays off the cost of this to a second insurer for a premium of £15 per policyholder. The second insurer procures the breakdown services in order to meet his obligations under the insurance contract with the primary insurer. The insurance premium paid by the direct insurer to the secondary insurer is subject to IPT, as is the premium paid by the policyholder to the primary insurer.</td>

Consideration should be given to what, as a matter of law, is the proper construction of the transaction agreement and the agreements governing the relationships of the parties (including the Joint Operating Agreement). Although there may be differences of opinion between the various parties concerning the interpretation of the facts and the documents, there will only be one correct position.

It will be necessary for the Inspector to inform himself as to the detailed way in which the reconciliation has been completed and presented. Provided the method of doing the reconciliation remains consistent it is to be anticipated that future reconciliations will be agreed more readily. The greatest value in reconciliations will therefore have been achieved by the time the reconciliation is completed.

As far as seems reasonable, having regard to the amount of the difference both in absolute terms and in relation to total expenditure, the company should endeavour to establish the reason or likely reason for the difference. In the final analysis it is a matter for judgement at what point and level an unexplained difference should be accepted. Clearly a difference representing excess PRT claimed expenditure over CT expenditure gives OTO more cause for concern than the reverse situation. It is in fact more likely on the evidence of completed reconciliations seen that the company will uncover PRT claimable but unclaimed expenditure as a result of the exercise. Additional expenditure claims submitted in these circumstances will be subjected to careful examination. Where for time limit reasons such an additional claim is submitted before submission and examination of the reconciliation concerned, examination of the PRT claim may need to be deferred until the reconciliation is submitted and examined.</td>

      <td>For pension input periods before reaching age 60, the pension input amount is calculated on the basis that each part of the benefit with a different normal pension age is calculated by reference to that normal pension age (as explained in](#Before) section above). It does not matter whether each part of the benefits relating to the ‘normal pension age 60’ and ‘normal pension age 65’ are all in the same arrangements or different ones (unless there are differences arising from negative values, as explained in Before reaching first split normal pension age section above).
