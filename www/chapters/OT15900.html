As OTA83\\S3A does not apply to expenditure on a long term asset incurred in the transitional period the allowance of any expenditure is subject to the normal rules of allowance and apportionment. The transitional provision ensures that the amount of tariffs that qualify as tax-exempt tariffing receipts are reduced by reference to any allowable long term asset expenditure in the transitional period that relates to tax-exempt business in respect of a user field. </p><p>The transitional provision applies where:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>expenditure was incurred in the period 9 April 2003 to 31 December 2003 by a participator in acquiring, bringing into existence or enhancing the value of a long term asset,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the expenditure is allowable for a claim period (<remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT04420:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT04420</remotelink>) ending after 9 April 2003</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>at the time the expenditure was incurred the asset was being, or was expected to be used to any extent in relation to an oil field or foreign field or oil won from an oil field or foreign field,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the use, or expected use, is use in a way that gives rise or would have given rise to tax-exempt tariffing receipts in a chargeable period (<remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT04005:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT04005</remotelink>) ending on or after 30 June 2004.</p></li><p>The transitional provision does not require there to have been use or expected use giving rise to tax-exempt tariffing receipts at the time the expenditure was incurred.
