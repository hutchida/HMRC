For the purposes of OTA83\\S6B the terms &#8220;dedicated tanker&#8221; and &#8220;non-dedicated tanker&#8221; refer to whether the tanker was dedicated or non-dedicated in relation to the existing field (<remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT15830:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT15830</remotelink>). A tanker is a dedicated tanker if it is a mobile asset dedicated to the existing field and that existing field is an oil field. A non-dedicated tanker is any tanker that is not a mobile asset dedicated to the existing oil field.
