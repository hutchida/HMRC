The tribunal agreed with our view that the goods were not freely given business gifts, but supplied in the course of business for non-monetary consideration that is the customer’s attendance at the presentation, which was central to the trader’s business and hence valuable consideration.</p><sup>3</sup><p>In Granada Group plc (LON/87/250Z and LON/88/137Z) the trader offered “free” meals to drivers of coaches carrying passengers as an inducement to bring potential customers to the facilities. The meals were not given to drivers of empty coaches. The tribunal found a direct link between the act of bringing passengers to the service area and the provision of the free meal.
