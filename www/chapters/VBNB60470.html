This package should contain all of the following:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Constitutions</p></li><p>These will help you work out whether there are one or several entities. If you decide that there is only one entity that should be registered for VAT the issue of who should account for the subscription income resolves itself.</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Subscriptions </p></li><p>You should get hold of full details of the amount of subscription paid by members of all categories. For example, associate members may pay a lower subscription than full members. This will enable you to work out what consideration is paid in return for particular supplies.</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Destination of subscriptions </p></li><p>You must be able to work out exactly what happens to all of a member&#8217;s subscription once it has been collected. For example:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Is the subscription collected by the local, regional or national level of the organisation?</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>If collected locally is all or part of the money passed up to the regional or national levels?</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>How much of the subscription is retained by each level of the organisation?</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Is any of the subscription received by the regional or national level returned to the lower levels of the organisation as a grant or subsidy towards their activities?</p></li><p>The answers to these questions should enable you to identify who gets the consideration. This will help you decide whether various tiers are receiving money in their own right or as agents for higher tiers.</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>What supplies are made and to whom? </p></li><p>You should establish both what supplies are made by each tier of the organisation. You should also establish to whom they are made. The individual members, for example, could be receiving some benefits from the local club and others directly from the regional or national tiers.</p><p>You should check for supplies that the tiers make to the levels of the organisation above and below them (rather than to the members).</p><p>This information is crucial to working out correctly whether and, if so, to what extent, the income received from the members or other parts of the organisation constitutes consideration for the supplies that each makes.</p><p>By identifying these supplies you will be able to work out whether, when a tier receives money, it is consideration or outside the scope income.
