Relief is therefore given in a field for expenditure incurred on closing down - or any of the other activities listed above - an asset (excepting non-dedicated mobile assets, see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT11100:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT11100</remotelink>), for which expenditure is allowable or has been allowed in that field. </p><p>Where a qualifying asset has been used otherwise than in connection with the field (e.g. in another field), there are specific apportionment rules, see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT10200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT10200</remotelink>.</p><h3>Leasing or Hiring of Qualifying Asset</h3><p>OTA75\\S3(1A) also provides that in the case where the qualifying asset is leased or hired, the word &#8216;decommissioning&#8217; is to be read as including the carrying out of any restoration or similar work which is required to be carried out under the terms of the contract of lease or hire. </p><h3>Exempt Gas</h3><p>Where the decommissioning takes place in a field that is producing or has produced &#8216;exempt gas&#8217;, there are special rules which restrict allowance under OTA75\\S3(1)(i), see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT10550:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT10550</remotelink>. </p><h3>Timing of Relief</h3><p>Relief can be given during a field&#8217;s life as well as at its end so long as the expenditure has been incurred.
