The intention is to prevent new risks, which would normally be the subject of a new policy, being added to a pre-rate change contract and therefore benefiting from a lower tax rate. The following examples illustrate this.</p><sup>6</sup><h4>Example 10 (1997)</h4><sup>7</sup><p>An insurer underwrites a policy covering a company’s fleet of cars and assumes the risk before 1 April 1997.</p><sup>8</sup><p>During the transitional period the company sells some vehicles and replaces them with other, more expensive, vehicles.</p><sup>9</sup><p>Following their normal practice the insurer does not create a new policy but simply extends the cover under the existing policy and calls for an additional premium, which they receive or write before 1 October 1997. The additional premium will be liable to IPT at 2.5 per cent (i.e. the old rate).</p><sup>10</sup><p></p><sup>11</sup><h4>Example 11 (1999)</h4><sup>12</sup><p>An insurer underwrites a policy - made before 1 July 1999, which covers a building in Somerset.</p><sup>13</sup><p>In August 1999 the owner of the building purchases a second building in central London and, to avoid IPT at the new rate, he asks for it to be covered under the policy which covers the building in Somerset. If it would be the insurer’s normal practice to create a new policy for the second building this building constitutes a new risk.</p><sup>14</sup><p>If the insurer agrees to add it to the original policy the related additional premium will be liable to IPT at 5 per cent, even if the insurer receives or writes it before 1 December 1999 because it is not the insurer’s normal practice to add new risks to existing policies.</p><sup>15</sup><p></p><sup>16</sup><h4>Example 12 (1999)</h4><sup>17</sup><p>The insurer underwrites a policy - before 1 July 1999. This covers four shops in a small arcade, with identical terms of cover.</p><sup>18</sup><p>The owner of the shops buys another one in the same arcade, and requires exactly the same cover. Following their normal practice, the insurer adds the fifth shop to the existing policy and calls for an additional premium, which they receive or write before 31 December 1999.</p><sup>19</sup><p>The additional premium will be liable to IPT at 4 per cent (the old rate).</p><sup>20</sup><p>This concept of normal practice is the insurer’s normal practice and not the market’s normal practice. Therefore a risk is ‘new’ if it would be the insurer’s normal practice to create a new contract or policy to cover that risk. Thus policing the transitional arrangements and making sure there is no abuse is very much down to the discretion of local officers and your knowledge of your insurer. If there is any attempt by an insurer to misrepresent his normal practice so as to benefit from this approach outlined here, you should consider assessing for the amount of tax which is under-declared.</p><sup>21</sup><p>All additional premiums written on or after the implementation date, in respect of taxable risks, are subject to the new rate, where the cover under the policy incepts on or after the implementation date. All additional premiums written on or after the concessionary date are subject to the new rate, regardless of when the policy incepted.</p><sup>22</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>23</sup><p> Next page</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\IPT07820.xml</p><hr/><sup>title</sup><h3>Additional Premiums</h3><sup>0</sup><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Additional premiums</p><sup>1</sup><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Please note this guidance is for rate rises from 1 June 2017.

To help decide whether such an addition (also known as a mid-term adjustment or “MTA”) constitutes a new risk the following definition was agreed with HMRC and Industry representatives:</p><sup>7</sup><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">“ A MTA will not be in respect of a new risk if it relates to cover under the policy at the time the policy commenced , so that if cover has not yet commenced the insurer is able to provide that cover if and when it is requested at any time during the life of the policy .

The policyholder advises the underwriter that an extension is being built attaching to the existing house in August 2017. It is a condition of the insurance contract that the underwriter is advised of any material changes to the property. An additional premium is charged effective from 23 August 2017 and is subject to the 10% rate of tax as it is permitted in the contract that such changes could take place within the existing policy.</p><sup>18</sup><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Example 4</p><sup>19</sup><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Commercial domestic cargo (open cover) policy incepting on 1 January 2017.
