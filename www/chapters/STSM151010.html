The provision is at Stamp Act 1891/S14(4), as follows:-</p><p>&#8220;&#8230;.an instrument executed in any part of the United Kingdom, or relating, wheresoever executed, to any property situate, or to any matter or thing done, in any part of the United Kingdom, shall not, except in criminal proceedings, be given in evidence, or be available for any purpose whatever, unless it is duly stamped in accordance with the law in force at the time it was executed.&#8221; </p><p>Documents are sent to the Birmingham Stamp Office for stamping.
