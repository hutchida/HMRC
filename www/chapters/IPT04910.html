Motor breakdown insurance, roadside assistance insurance, legal expenses insurance, MOT insurance and &#8220;parts&#8221; insurance (such as cover for tyres) relate to a motor vehicle and are liable to the higher rate of IPT when provided in these circumstances. Personal accident insurance which covers the insured in connection with a motor vehicle, for example whilst driving or whilst getting in or out of a vehicle, will also be liable to the higher rate of IPT when sold in these circumstances.</p><p>&#8220;Ordinary&#8221; motor insurance sold by motor dealers is not liable to the higher rate of IPT.

This new type of GAP insurance was not tied into any finance arrangements meaning that any compensation received in the event of a claim could be put to whatever uses the insured wished (i.e. it did not necessarily have to be used to pay off any outstanding finance). The non-financial gap insurance allowed motor dealers greater flexibility in pricing and lent itself to tax manipulation.</p><p>Therefore, from 1 April 2004, non-financial GAP insurance became liable to the higher rate of IPT when sold through suppliers of motor vehicles or persons connected to them.</p><p>Regardless of what the policy is called, the key is identifying whether the GAP insurance relates to a financial agreement or to a motor vehicle. If there is no finance agreement in place, then premiums paid under the GAP policy will be subject to the higher rate. Where there is a finance agreement, but the contract of insurance allows the policy holder flexibility with any payout, for example if they can decide to put half towards any outstanding loan and the other half towards the purchase of another vehicle, then all premiums receivable under the contract are liable to the higher rate. However, where a contract states that the policyholder must pay off any outstanding finance then the premiums are subject to the standard rate.

For businesses using the special accounting scheme, this revised treatment applied to premiums written in respect of annual contracts commencing on or after 1 April 2004.</p><p>Suppliers of motor vehicles who charge a separate insurance-related fee in connection with non-financial gap insurance, were liable to register as a taxable intermediary and account for higher rate IPT on their fees with effect from 1 April 2004.</p><p>&#160;</p><h3>Other insurance supplied with a motor car or motor vehicle</h3><p>Certain other insurance policies relating to a motor vehicle and arranged or supplied by the person who supplies motor vehicles will also be subject to the higher rate. For example, insurance against accidental damage to the windscreen of a car or &#8220;key&#8221; insurance. Typically &#8220;key&#8221; insurance might cover the loss or theft of car keys. As the insurance relates to a motor vehicle it is subject to the higher rate. However, sometimes these policies may also include cover for house keys etc., which would be subject to the standard rate (5% or 6% from the 4 January 2011). In those circumstances, the premium should be apportioned.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT04905:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT04915:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>Paragraph 2(6) of Schedule 6A, inserted by the Finance Act 1997, states:</p><p>In this paragraph &#8220;motor car&#8221; and &#8220;motor cycle&#8221; have the meaning given</p><p>(a) by section 185(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1988 or</p><p>(b) in Northern Ireland, by Article 3(1) of the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1995.</p><p>This effectively covers cars, motorcycles and light vans.
