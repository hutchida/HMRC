Therefore, in such cases, if you don’t have additional factual evidence of the existence of a single entity, you should accept that there are separate entities but consider whether the business has been artificially separated.</p><sup>3</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>4</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
