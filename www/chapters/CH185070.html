Mr Smith did not comply with the file access notice and therefore became liable for an initial penalty on 2 May 2015.</p><sup>3</sup><p>The time limit for assessing the initial penalty is 2 May 2016, which is 12 months from when Mr Smith became liable to the initial penalty. Although Mr Smith became liable for the initial penalty on 2 May 2015, we would probably allow a period of grace before assessing it. We assessed an initial penalty on Mr Smith on 15 May 2015.</p><sup>4</sup><p>If Mr Smith still fails to comply with the file access notice we would consider charging daily penalties. Although we would allow a period of grace to see whether the initial penalty prompts compliance, daily penalties could be charged from 16 May 2015, being the day after the initial penalty. Even if we start charging daily penalties after 16 May 2015, we still only have 12 months from the first day after 15 May 2015 (the date on which he became liable to the penalty).
