The company will not need to pay the Section 455 or Section 464A tax if the loan is repaid/released/written off, or a return payment made before the tax falls due, because the company will then be entitled to relief under Section 458 or Section 464B.

Where you are aware of a company which is to liquidate or dissolve and, for example, a loan repayment is to be made, advise the company that the repayment must be made in an accounting period.

The material date for repayment interest on loans or advances taxed under the new rules will normally depend on the date the loan is repaid, released or written off or a return payment made.
