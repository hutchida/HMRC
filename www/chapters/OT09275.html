Any allocation method, if it is to be acceptable, would be expected to differentiate between central stocks that are clearly of potential use in some fields only, and those central stocks that might potentially be used over the full range of a company’s interests.</p><sup>3</sup><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">See OT13840 where stocks are used for OTA75\SCH7 purposes and the relevant expenditure constitutes expenditure on long-term assets.</p></div></div></body></html>
