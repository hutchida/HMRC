This limit is based on the benefits held under the paying scheme and any benefits previously paid to the member by any registered pension scheme. Because of this, when a scheme wants to pay a PCLS the scheme administrator needs to know the &#8216;available portion of the member&#8217;s lump sum allowance&#8217; so as to be able to calculate the amount that they may pay as a PCLS from that scheme.</p><p>Normally the &#8216;available portion of the member&#8217;s lump sum allowance&#8217; is based on the amount the member has previously crystallised.
