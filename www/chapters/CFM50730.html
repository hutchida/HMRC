Fixed-rate preference shares, for example, give an entitlement to receive distributions and are therefore an excluded subject matter. On the other hand, shares which only give the holder a right to receive capital distributions in a winding-up will not be excluded. This is because CTA10/Part 23 says that such capital distributions are not distributions for the purposes of the Taxes Acts.</p><sup>5</sup><p>A building society share is not a share for the purposes of Part 7. This is because CTA10/S1055 says that dividends or interest payable on a building society share are not distributions - so no ‘entitlement to distributions’ can arise on such shares.</p><sup>6</sup><p>Where a company has no share capital (for example, a company limited by guarantee), the definition includes any interests in the company possessed by members of the company.</p><sup>7</sup><p>It also includes a depositary receipt for shares. A depositary receipt is a certificate that represents ownership of a certain number of shares, and which in many cases can be traded independently of the shares.</p><sup>8</sup><h3>Units in a unit trust</h3><sup>9</sup><p>The rights of a unit holder under a unit trust scheme are also an excluded subject matter (unless the holding is one that is treated as a creditor loan relationship under CTA09/S490).
