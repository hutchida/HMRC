If you are looking at an earlier period, or the company was no longer party to the derivative at 3 pm on 16 March 2005, see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CFM83070:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CFM83070</remotelink>.</p><h3>Meaning of &#8216;shares&#8217;</h3><p>&#8216;Shares&#8217; is defined at CTA09/S710 to mean any shares in a company under which an entitlement to receive distributions may arise.</p><p>Distribution is not specifically defined in Part 7 so you need to look primarily at CTA10/Part 23 to find out what is a distribution. Fixed-rate preference shares, for example, give an entitlement to receive distributions and are therefore an excluded subject matter. On the other hand, shares which only give the holder a right to receive capital distributions in a winding-up will not be excluded. This is because CTA10/Part 23 says that such capital distributions are not distributions for the purposes of the Taxes Acts.</p><p>A building society share is not a share for the purposes of Part 7. This is because CTA10/S1055 says that dividends or interest payable on a building society share are not distributions - so no &#8216;entitlement to distributions&#8217; can arise on such shares.</p><p>Where a company has no share capital (for example, a company limited by guarantee), the definition includes any interests in the company possessed by members of the company.</p><p>It also includes a depositary receipt for shares. A depositary receipt is a certificate that represents ownership of a certain number of shares, and which in many cases can be traded independently of the shares.</p><h3>Units in a unit trust</h3><p>The rights of a unit holder under a unit trust scheme are also an excluded subject matter (unless the holding is one that is treated as a creditor loan relationship under CTA09/S490). The same rules apply to derivatives over unit trust units as apply to derivatives over shares, and where the following guidance refers to share-based derivatives, it should be read as also applying to derivatives over unit trust units.</p><h3>Summary of tax treatment of share-based derivatives</h3><p>If the underlying subject matter of a relevant contract is shares (and nothing else) it will in many cases still be within the derivative contracts rules.</p><p>There are, however, five cases in which a contract over shares is excluded.
