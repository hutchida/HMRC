The fundamental requirement in TIOPA10 SCH7A/PARA38 is for a reporting company to keep such records as are needed for it to be able to submit a complete and correct return for a period of account.</p><sup>2</sup><p>Normally records must be kept until 6 years after the period, although HMRC may specify a shorter period for some or all records. Where the company is required to submit a return, it is required to keep records until such time (if later) as any enquiry is complete or a normal time limits enquiry cannot be opened. The information may be preserved in any form – subject to any conditions or exceptions specified in writing by HMRC (PARA38(6)).</p><sup>3</sup><p>The Commissioners of Revenue and Customs may make regulations specifying which records do, or do not, need to be kept and preserved – PARA38(7).</p><sup>4</sup><p>Penalties for failure to keep and preserve records are dealt with under PARA39, see CFM99100.</p><sup>5</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
