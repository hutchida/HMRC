The tax point will be 25 January 1997. He is liable to account for IPT at 4% on the proportion of the premium attributable to the period 1 April 1998 to 31 December 1999.

This is achieved by deeming the contract to have been made on the date of the rate change (see section 67B(5) of the Finance Act 1994 as inserted by the Finance Act 1997).</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT07840:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT07850:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>Contracts providing cover for a period exceeding 12 months</p><p>If a taxable premium is received or written after the date of announcement of a rate change but before the implementation date and the period of cover begins before the implementation date and ends on or after the first anniversary of the change, then an apportionment must be made to calculate the correct IPT due.</p><p>The IPT due on that proportion of the premium attributable to the period from the inception date to the anniversary of the rate change can be calculated at the old rate.
