These regulations only apply where a number of conditions are met, including the fact that the lump sum was based on an incorrect amount of scheme pension or, as the case may be, an incorrect purchase price for a lifetime annuity.

It is reasonably believed that the amount of this lump sum was the proper amount of pension commencement lump sum and did not exceed the permitted maximum (in this case &#163;30,000). The BCE 6 was processed on the basis of the amount of &#163;30,000.</p><p>However, in February 2015 it transpires there was an error in the remuneration figures the employer had supplied to the scheme, and that Darren&#8217;s scheme pension had been set inadvertently at too high an amount. Darren had in fact, only really been entitled to part of the pension he received. The administrator decides not recover the overpayment but allows it to stand (under regulation 13). The administrator does however adjust the level of Darren&#8217;s pension down to the correct amount for future payments. Because the amount of the lump sum had been based on the inflated pension, it exceeded the permitted maximum, so with hindsight, not all of it qualified as a pension commencement lump sum. The administrator re-calculates that only &#163;25,000 of the lump sum should count as the true pension commencement lump sum (the amount representing the permitted maximum by reference to the pension at its proper amount).</p><p>The BCE 6 is recalculated by reference to the &#163;25,000 that Darren was entitled to on 1 October 2014 as part of the &#163;30,000 lump sum actually paid.</p><p>The difference between what should have been paid and what was paid (&#163;5,000) is processed as a BCE 9 which also occurred on 1 October 2014 (and not 1 December 2014 when the actual &#163;30,000 lump sum was paid to Darren).</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM088700:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>PCLS-type lump sums paid after death</h3><p>The formalities for payment of a pension commencement lump sum (PCLS) normally have to be finalised during a member&#8217;s lifetime.
