However, this is changed by amendments to TIOPA10/SCH7A in F(2)A17/SCH8/PARAS15-17.</p><sup>4</sup><h4>Company tax return amendment procedure</h4><sup>5</sup><p>Where a company has submitted a company tax return and an interest restriction return has been submitted that causes information included in the tax return to be incorrect, PARA70(1A) requires to company to amend its tax return so as to correct the information.</p><sup>6</sup><p>In the first instance, where the change results from the allocation of a taxinterest restriction or a reactivation the amounts to be disallowed or reactivated follow the default rules in S377 or S380. Alternatively, the company may elect to override the default rule and substitute its own identification.</p><sup>7</sup><p>If no event supersedes the requirement to amend the return, the company must amend its company tax return by the later of:</p><sup>8</sup><p>3 months of the submission of the interest restriction return; and</p><sup>9</sup><p>the normal time limit for amending a company tax return in FA98/SCH18/PARA15(4). This is usually 24 months after an accounting period, but may differ where company periods of account are long or where the notice requiring the filing of a return was served late.</p><sup>10</sup><h4>Consequences of failure to amend return</h4><sup>11</sup><p>If the company fails to amend its return within this time limit (and no other event, such as the submission of a revised interest restriction return, or the making of a valid election under s377 or S380, has intervened to supersede the requirement to amend the company tax return), PARA70A provides that:</p><sup>12</sup><p>the company becomes liable to a penalty of £500. The penalty is administered in the same way as a penalty for failure to deliver an interest restriction return.</p><sup>13</sup><p>HMRC may amend the company tax return, within a time limit of 12 months.</p><sup>14</sup><p>If the company disagrees with the HMRC amendment, it has three months in which to make its own amendment.</p><sup>15</sup><p>After this process, the company may still amend its return if, within the applicable time limits, it makes an election under s377 or S380 or a revised interest restriction return is submitted which, once more, renders its company tax return incorrect.</p><sup>16</sup><p>For the position where no interest restriction return or a non-compliant return is submitted, see CFM98654.</p><sup>17</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>18</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
