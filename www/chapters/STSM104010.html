A corresponding SDRT charge applies to the surrender or transfer of shares in an Open-Ended Investment Company (OEIC) to the Authorised Corporate Director of the OEIC by virtue of the Stamp Duty &amp; Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (Open-Ended Investment Companies) Regulations 1997 (SI 1997/1156).</p><sup>1</sup><p>Specifically, SDRT is calculated by reference to the total value of all units (or OEIC shares) that are surrendered during a one-week ‘charging period’. A ‘charging period’ means a week covering a period of seven days beginning with a Sunday.</p><sup>2</sup><p>A notice that is required under Regulation 4B of the Stamp Duty Reserve Tax Regulations 1986 (SI 1986/1711 ) to be completed by the manager or Authorised Corporate Director of a fund scheme and sent to HMRC each month on or before the ‘accountable date’, will typically cover a four or five week period.</p><sup>3</sup><p>The FA99/SCH19 SDRT charge applies only to units or OEIC shares which are effectively surrendered back to a fund scheme in exchange for a cash amount that is equivalent to the value of the unit/OEIC shares previously held.</p><sup>4</sup><p>Exceptionally, a similar charge can arise where units or OEIC shares are surrendered back to the fund scheme but the unit/share holder receives, by way of distribution, a share of each investment property held by the fund scheme that is not, however, proportionate to the holder’s entitlement (‘a non-pro rata in specie redemption’).</p><sup>5</sup><p>See STSM101020 for the meaning of a unit trust.</p><sup>6</sup><p>See STSM101050 for the meaning of an open-ended investment company.</p><sup>7</sup><p>See STSM103060 for the meaning of ‘accountable date’.</p><sup>8</sup><p>See STSM105100 for guidance on pro rata and non-pro rata in specie redemptions.</p><sup>9</sup><p>See STSM104080 for guidance on completion and content of a notice under Regulation 4B SDRT Regulations 1986.</p><sup>10</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
