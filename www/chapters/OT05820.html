Also onshore terminals and some offshore blended oil installations have storage facilities whereby all the oil produced from the fields making up the blend may not actually be loaded on to tankers as it is delivered to the loading facility.</p><sup>4</sup><p>Therefore these agreements are not sufficient to provide a neutral determination of the field source (and quantities) in respect of a company’s lifting of oil in a blend.</p><sup>5</sup><p>At some of these loading facilities the operator will determine how a participator’s liftings in a particular month are allocated across its field interests. The allocation basis being based upon the participator’s actual or estimated share of available blended oil (opening stock and production) in the month in question. However the lifting agreements at most of the larger facilities (and some others) allow the producer a large degree of discretion over how a particular lifting of oil is allocated between its field interests. This means that a producer can assign more of a lifting to a field than its share of available blend production would merit (overlift) or assign less (underlift). The lifting agreements will contain parameters to ensure that a company’s field interest does not become too over- or under -lifted.

These contracts allow the purchaser to acquire the seller’s oil production from one or more of its field interests for a certain period (usually either 6 months or a year) in a blend in return for regular payments based upon the seller’s estimated monthly production entitlement from the field interests covered by the contract.
