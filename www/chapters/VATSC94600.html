This may also allow the lender to extend the statutory powers of a receiver as set out in the Law of Property Act 1925. If these powers are specifically extended then he is held to be an agent for the lender, unless the deed expressly provides that the receiver is to be regarded as an agent for the borrower.</p><sup>1</sup><p>Receivers may also be appointed by the courts. In these circumstances, the receiver supplies services to the court.</p><sup>2</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>3</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
