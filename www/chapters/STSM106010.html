Any payment in respect of SDRT in connection with the transfer will depend on this figure. In recognition of this, it is acceptable to HM Revenue &amp; Customs for the value to be taken as the redemption price at the time the unit/OEIC share holder sends the instruction authorising the fund manager or trustee to register or otherwise record the transfer; provided this is undertaken consistently and promptly thereafter.</p><sup>7</sup><p>See</p><sup>8</sup><p>See</p><sup>9</sup><p>See</p><sup>10</sup><p>See</p><sup>11</sup><p>See</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\STSM106010.xml</p><hr/><sup>0</sup><p>There are occasions whereby a holder of units in a unit trust or shares in an Open-Ended Investment Company (OEIC) agrees to sell and transfer his units/OEIC shares to a third party purchaser for consideration in money or money’s worth.</p><sup>1</sup><p>In this situation, it may be necessary, however, for the agreed transaction to be notified to the relevant fund manager of the unit trust or OEIC.
