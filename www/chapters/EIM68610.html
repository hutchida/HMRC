The agreement reflects the legislation on employee travel that applied up to 1997/98 and that can now be found in Section 337 ITEPA 2003. It has not been updated to reflect the legislation on travel for necessary attendance in Section 338 ITEPA 2003, or subsequent changes. Therefore the agreement needs to be modified by the guidance at EIM32000 and EIM31200 onwards.</p><sup>2</sup><p></p><sup>3</sup><p> Previous page</p></div></body></html>
