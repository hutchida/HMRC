The company becomes liable to a penalty of £500 if it fails to amend its return within the time limit. The penalty is administered in the same way as a penalty for failure to deliver an interest restriction return. For the circumstances in which such a company level penalty can arise, see CFM98630+.</p><sup>2</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
