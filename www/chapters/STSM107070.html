The amalgamation was a scheme of arrangement which took its effect by operation of law, under the terms of the trust deed of the discontinuing scheme, the Financial Services Act 1986 and the Financial Services (regulated Schemes) Regulations 1991. Accordingly, the amalgamation did not take effect as the result of an agreement between the parties.</p><sup>5</sup><p>There was no ‘transfer’ of units in the discontinuing scheme to the unit holders of the enlarged scheme. The units in the discontinuing scheme were surrendered in return for new units in the (enlarged) continuing scheme.</p><sup>6</sup><p>Consequently, following the Special Commissioner’s decision, HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) accept that no SDRT charge arises under FA86/S87 on a merger/amalgamation of two authorised unit trusts, provided the transaction in question takes place under a scheme of arrangement which has effect by virtue of:</p><sup>7</sup><p>section 251 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000; and</p><sup>8</sup><p>The appropriate section of the Financial Conduct Authority Handbook of Rules and Guidance.</p><sup>9</sup><p>See STSM101030 for the meaning of an authorised unit trust.</p><sup>10</sup><p>See STSM107050 for stamp implications on the conversion of an authorised unit trust to an Open-Ended Investment Company.</p><sup>11</sup><p>See STSM107060 for stamp implications on the amalgamation of an authorised unit trust to an Open-Ended Investment Company.</p><sup>12</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>13</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
