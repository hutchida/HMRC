This means that the partnership is consolidated into X plc’s financial statements. X plc has an operating profit of 100 with third party interest expense of 75. The partnership has operating profits of 150 and 30 of third party interest expense.</p><sup>1</sup><p></p><sup>2</sup><h4>The position without the election</h4><sup>3</sup><p>Firstly assume that an election is not made.</p><sup>4</sup><p></p><sup>5</sup><p>For the purpose of calculating the group ratio X plc picks up a small amount of interest but a large amount of group-EBITDA from the partnership. The group ratio is calculated on a group-EBITDA of 250. However when calculating the interest allowance the group ratio is applied to a tax-EBITDA of 175. This disparity between group-EBITDA and tax-EBITDA causes an interest restriction of 16.</p><sup>6</sup><h4>With the consolidated partnership election</h4><sup>7</sup><p>Applying the same figures and making an interest allowance (consolidated partnerships) election. Under this election the financial statements for the group are assumed to include a share of the partnership’s profits instead of being fully consolidated.</p><sup>8</sup><p>The election is applied by treating the partnership as a joint venture. The election increases the group ratio to 47% and reduces the interest restriction to 8.</p><sup>9</sup><p>However, the worldwide group also has the option to elect into the Investment Allowance (non-consolidated investment) election.</p><sup>10</sup><h4>With the consolidated partnership and non-consolidated investment elections</h4><sup>11</sup><p>Applying the same figures and making an interest allowance (consolidated partnerships) election and an interest allowance (non-consolidated investment) election.</p><sup>12</sup><p>Here the effect of the non-consolidated investment election with the consolidated partnership election increases the group ratio to 51%. X plc’s net tax-interest expense is not restricted.</p><sup>13</sup><p> Previous page</p></div></body></html>
