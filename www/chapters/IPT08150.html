This does not constitute an overpayment and is the responsibility of insurers. For example, there may be situations where insurers have not applied the *de minimis *ESC when they could. This may be the result of a positive commercial decision because efficiency savings outweigh the burden on insurers or their customers. In such cases it is important to record that the insurer is aware of what he is doing and why.
