You may visit insurers who have organised their operations in such a way as to increase their liability to IPT compared to what it might have been if other arrangements had been put in place. This does not constitute an overpayment and is the responsibility of insurers. For example, there may be situations where insurers have not applied the *de minimis *ESC when they could. This may be the result of a positive commercial decision because efficiency savings outweigh the burden on insurers or their customers. In such cases it is important to record that the insurer is aware of what he is doing and why.
