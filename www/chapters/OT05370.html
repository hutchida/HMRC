If the position appears to be clear then the Board&#8217;s notice should be issued in time for it to apply for the next chargeable period even if there is insufficient time for correspondence with the company.

It may also be noticed from FA82\\SCH18\\PARA6(4) that the Board must consider any notice from companies without reference to any new price formula proposed, which implies that it is not sufficient to show that a different price formula is more appropriate than the election formula. It is perhaps also significant that, in the case of an election involving gases other than ethane for petrochemical use, in the event of a notice being validly given, any new price formula must be judged at the same point in time as the original formula but taking into account the changed economic circumstances.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>In general it appears that the legislation contemplates that the price formula will apply for the period specified in the election and that it would only be re-opened under FA82\\SCH18\\PARA6 in rare circumstances.
