But because of TCGA92/S138A it is treated as a conversion of securities within TCGA92/S132. TCGA92/S127 applies with the necessary adaptations to the part disposal and part of the base cost of the `notional security’ is transferred to the holding of shares in P Ltd.</p><sup>28</sup><p>The procedure for obtaining valuations of the right to deferred unascertainable consideration is described at CG14950.</p><sup>29</sup><p>SHARES IN P LTD</p><sup>30</sup><p>The shares in P Ltd which are acquired go into the Section 104 holding of shares of the same class.
