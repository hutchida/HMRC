The most common of these is the Stock Transfer Form (STF), but any document that completes an agreement to buy and sell stock or marketable securities falls within the SD charge. See STSM014010 for the rate of duty. The transfer of certain types of stock and marketable securities is exempt from charge, particularly types of loan stock falling within the provisions of Section 79 Finance Act 1986. See STSM021220.</p><sup>1</sup><p>The creation or conversion of shares into bearer form must be notified to HMRC Stamp Taxes by forms B.1.1 and B.1.2. The B.1.2 attracts the SD charge.
