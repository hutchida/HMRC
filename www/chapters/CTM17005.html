The amount of the stock dividend for tax purposes is the amount of the alternative cash dividend. This is providing the market value of the new shares on the relevant date does not substantially differ (see CTM17010) from the amount of the cash dividend.</p><p>CTA10/S1049 applies to share capital issued by a UK resident company. Where a non-UK resident company declares a cash dividend and shareholders are given the option of taking up further shares instead, CTA10/S1049 does not apply and there is no distribution unless CTA10/S1026 applies. See also CG51823.</p><p>A basic or higher rate taxpayer may opt to receive a stock dividend if more interested in enlarging shareholding rather than receiving cash. The stock dividend will allow the taxpayer to increase shareholding without incurring dealing costs.</p><p>The situation will be different for:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>an exempt institutional investor such as a pension fund,</p></li><p>or</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>an individual for whom the tax credit on a dividend made prior to 6 April 1999 would be payable,</p></li><p>as the notional IT on a stock dividend cannot be repaid.</p><p>The legislation on stock dividends at CTA10/S1049 to S1053 applies where the shares are issued to:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>individuals,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>personal representatives of deceased persons,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>trustees of discretionary trusts.</p></li><p>See ITTOIA06/S409 and S410.

This is so even if the stock dividend comprises redeemable share capital or follows a repayment of share capital. Also, a stock dividend cannot constitute the first leg of a potential distribution by virtue of CTA10/S1026 (which provides that if a company makes a bonus issue of shares followed by a repayment of that share capital, the repayment is not treated as such).</p><p>SAIM5170 gives details of the income tax charge. The stock dividend legislation does not affect company shareholders except where the company holds shares as a trustee of a discretionary trust.</p><p>The bonus issue of shares is not income in the company&#8217;s hands, applying the principle established in CIR v Blott (1921) 8TC101 and CIR v Wright (1926) 11TC181.</p><p>However, the legislation at CTA10/S1000 C (bonus redeemable shares) and CTA10/S1022 and S1026 (bonus issues linked with share capital repayment) continue to apply where a company receives a stock dividend.</p><p>If the recipient of a stock dividend comprising redeemable shares is a UK resident company, so that there remains a distribution within CTA10/S1000 C:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>CTA09/PART9A provides (subject to exceptions) that CT is not chargeable on distributions, nor are distributions taken into account in computing income for CT purposes, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>as a distribution within CTA10/S1000 C does not carry a tax credit the distribution does not represent franked investment income (FII) in the recipient company&#8217;s hands.</p></li><p>A bonus issue of shares that is received by a company is thus generally not income or FII. Also, the company acquires no additional CG cost for the shares, TCGA92/S141 (1).</p><p>If a company issues a stock dividend to an individual etc after repaying share capital, there is no liability under CTA10/S1022, which provides that if a company repays share capital and then makes a bonus issue of shares, the bonus issue is treated as a distribution. However, if the company issues the stock dividend either wholly or partly to any other member such as a company, CTA10/S1049 (3) does not apply to that part. In these circumstances the company has issued the stock dividend other than for new consideration, and liability may arise on the issuing company under CTA10/S1022 (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM15420:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CTM15420</remotelink>).

These are purchased on their behalf by a plan administrator usually through a low cost dealing arrangement. These are not stock dividends and there is normal distribution treatment.</p><h3>Procedure</h3><p>Only quoted companies are likely to issue stock dividends which serve a commercial purpose.
