We do not expect reconciliations from companies or groups which do not have interests in taxpaying fields. However, if a customer is a new entrant to the UKCS and will at a future date have taxpaying fields, it should be advised of the possible future requirement so it can, if it wishes, build the necessary functionality into its system.</p><sup>4</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>5</sup><p> Next page</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\OT18660.xml</p><hr/><sup>title</sup><h3 style="background-color: #FFFF00">PRT Compliance: Risk Working - PRT / Accounts Reconciliations</h3><sup>0</sup><p>At OT18570 we outline the obligations of companies within the framework of the TCRM Process.</p><sup>1</sup><p>Reconciliations should be part of a company’s PRT accounting system.
