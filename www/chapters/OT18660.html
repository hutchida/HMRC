Claims for a period do not have to be made at the same time as the corresponding return. Without a control process it is possible for claims to be made more than once - or for expenditure not to be claimed - and for miscellaneous income and insurance receipts to be omitted.

Companies can perceive their provision as onerous. If companies claim that their systems have internal controls that address our concerns and they would prefer us to audit their processes to demonstrate this point we should consider engaging Audit specialists for this purpose. We do not expect reconciliations from companies or groups which do not have interests in taxpaying fields. However, if a customer is a new entrant to the UKCS and will at a future date have taxpaying fields, it should be advised of the possible future requirement so it can, if it wishes, build the necessary functionality into its system.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT18650:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT18670:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>At <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_OT18570:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT18570</remotelink> we outline the obligations of companies within the framework of the TCRM Process.</p><p>Reconciliations should be part of a company&#8217;s PRT accounting system.
