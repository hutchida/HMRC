This identifies in advance that the transaction is to be made under the terms of a contract which directs the supply via the card company. If the card is produced after the fuel has passed into the cardholderâ€™s tank, then the supply is from the garage to the cardholders.</p><sup>2</sup><p>The garage agreement must also contain a number of extra clauses if the scheme is to work:</p><sup>3</sup><p>There should be a clause stating that on production of the card the fuel is supplied to the fuel card company by the garage.</p><sup>4</sup><p>As the fuel card company cannot physically make the supply of fuel at the pump, there should also be a clause indicating that the garage is acting as agent of the card company in effecting the supply.</p><sup>5</sup><p>All these factors are vital if the fuel card company wishes to be seen as a principal in the transaction. However, provided the contractual and other circumstances indicate that the supply is via the card company and officers have no reason for suspicion, we do not expect officers to actively police the requirement to show the card before purchase.</p><sup>6</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>7</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
