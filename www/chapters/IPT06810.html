For example, a retailer selling relevant goods could treat the income received for arranging the insurance as a fee earned under a separate contract between the retailer and the customer.

To prevent this, a provision was needed which made the fees charged by certain intermediaries liable to IPT at the higher rate. This is achieved by treating such fees as insurance premiums.
