In this case the amount of the distribution requirement is limited to the distributable reserves (CTA2010/S530(3) and (5)). There is special provision in the interest restriction rules to prevent a scenario where an amount of restricted interest could lead, in the absence of CTA10/S530(3) and (5), to a REIT having to make a PID that was larger than its distributable reserves.</p><sup>4</sup><p>The interest restriction rules specify that the allocated disallowance for the PRB company must be limited so that S530 (3) or (5) CTA 2010 do not apply.</p><sup>5</sup><h4>Example:</h4><sup>6</sup><p>Company A has a tax-EBITDA of £20,000 and tax-interest of £12,000. It has retained profits of £10,000 and PRB profits (before interest disallowance) £7500. The maximum PID it can make is £10,000.</p><sup>7</sup><p>To ensure that it has sufficient reserves to make the PID the maximum disallowance that can be allocated to PRB is £3611. This would give PRB profits of £11,111 and therefore a requirement to make a PID of £10,000 (90% of £11,111). The balance of the disallowance would be allocated to residual</p><sup>8</sup><p>Note that the company is not required to allocate this amount to the PRB. It has flexibility to allocate disallowances so that the full amount goes to the residual business.</p></div></body></html>
