This is because the cancellation of units or OEIC shares is not regarded as being a ‘surrender’ for the purposes of a FA99/SCH19 charge under paragraph 2(1), or an ‘agreement to transfer’ under FA86/S87.</p><sup>3</sup><p>See STSM101020 for the meaning of a unit trust.</p><sup>4</sup><p>See STSM101050 for the meaning of an Open-Ended Investment Company.</p><sup>5</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>6</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
