The first is where the company makes a return for a period that is treated in the return as an AP, but it is not an AP. The second is where the return is made on the basis that there is no AP ending in or at the end of the specified period, but there is such an AP.</p><sup>7</sup><h4>Filing date and enquiry window for a return made for the wrong period</h4><sup>8</sup><p>Where a return is made for a wrong period, the time allowed for the issue of a notice of enquiry into that return is determined by reference to the</p><sup>9</sup><h4>Closure notice for enquiry into the wrong period</h4><sup>10</sup><p>If you conclude that the return was for the wrong period, your closure notice must designate the AP for which a return should have been made, specifying the dates on which the period begins and ends.</p><sup>11</sup><p>Where there is more than one AP ending in or at the end of the period specified in the notice to deliver, your closure notice must designate the first of those APs for which no return has been delivered.

See COM71061 for further information.</p><sup>16</sup><p>You then use function RAMA (Record / Amend Assessment) to issue the closure notice from the AP for which the return should have been made.</p><sup>17</sup><p>You should include a free format message to make it clear that as part of the enquiry conclusions, the closure notice also designates the period for which the return should have been made. When issued, the closure notice shows the start and end dates of the correct AP.</p><sup>18</sup><p>See:</p><sup>19</sup><p>COM71011 for a list of functions to use in particular situations</p><sup>20</sup><p>COM71012 for legislation applying to this subject.</p><sup>21</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>22</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
