That person enters into the transaction with the subjective intention of giving some gratuitous benefit to the other person.</p><sup>1</sup><p>WHERE ONE OF THE PARTIES TO A TRANSACTION HAS THE INTENTION OF CONFERRING A GRATUITOUS BENEFIT ON ANOTHER PARTY TO THE TRANSACTION THEN THE TRANSACTION IS OTHERWISE THAN BY WAY OF A BARGAIN MADE AT ARM’S LENGTH AND THE MARKET VALUE RULE APPLIES.</p><sup>2</sup><p>This test can apply to a wide range of circumstances. The examples given only cover a small number of the possible circumstances.</p><sup>3</sup><p>EXAMPLE</p><sup>4</sup><p>John gives Sarah a painting worth £100,000.</p><sup>5</sup><p>Clearly John intended to confer a gratuitous benefit on Sarah and the transaction is ‘otherwise than by way of a bargain made at arm’s length’.</p><sup>6</sup><p>The market value of the painting should be brought in as John’s disposal proceeds in his capital gains computation. Sarah will have an acquisition cost of £100,000 for the painting.</p><sup>7</sup><p>EXAMPLE</p><sup>8</sup><p>Mr K Brown sells 100 shares in the family trading company to his nephew, Alec Brown, at par, for £1 each. The shares are worth £100 each. Mr K Brown has knowingly sold the shares at undervalue and intended to confer a gratuitous benefit on his nephew. An uncle and nephew are not connected persons so the subjective intention test has to be applied in order to use the market value rule.</p><sup>9</sup><p>The market value of the shares, supplied by Shares and Assets Valuation, should be used as Mr K Brown’s disposal proceeds and as Alec Brown’s acquisition cost.</p><sup>10</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>11</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
