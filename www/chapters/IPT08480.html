Here, as above, IPT is calculated on the gross premium due for the entire cover (where the insurance contracts are both/all subject to IPT). Where the main supply of insurance and the add-on are supplied under separate contracts, each insurer would be responsible for accounting for the tax on their own contracts. Where an add-on involves two or more insurers covering separate risks under one contract with a policyholder, each insurer is responsible for accounting to HMRC for the IPT chargeable on the element of the premium they receive, subject to the apportionment agreed between them. </p></li><li><lilabel>3</lilabel><p>The service may be supplied under a contract of insurance provided by an insurer (the add-on insurer) to the primary insurer who has a contract with a policyholder. The add-on in this scenario is a cost component of the primary insurer. IPT is due on the premium payable by the primary insurer to the add-on insurer, unless the contract between them is not taxable.

One example is a free hire car provided following an accident, supplied by an insurer underwriting comprehensive motor insurance. The insurer underwriting the contract of insurance must account for IPT on the gross premium due under the contract of insurance, which will include the cost of the non-insurance element to the insurer.

The payment for the non-insurance service does not attract a liability to IPT, even though the add-on is supplied as part of a package with insurance, since the add-on is not a contract of insurance and is supplied under a separate contract. The premium for the insurance element of the package will be liable to IPT if the contract is a taxable insurance contract.</p></li><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT08475:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT08485:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>&#8216;Add-ons&#8217; are additional services supplied with a contract of insurance.
