The higher the lifetime allowance level, the lower the proportion of their lifetime allowance a particular BCE will use up. For example if &#163;300,000 crystallises at a BCE, this represents 20 per cent of a standard lifetime allowance of &#163;1.5 million, but only 10 per cent of a &#163;3 million enhanced lifetime allowance.</p><h3>How the factors are calculated</h3><p>The lifetime allowance enhancement factors are calculated by comparing:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the capital value of the individual&#8217;s benefits being included in the lifetime allowance enhancement process, with</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the level of the standard lifetime allowance at the time the event giving rise to the factor occurs.</p></li><p>After 5 April 2006 these events will be either:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the overseas transfer being received into the scheme (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM095400:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM095400</remotelink> for more detail),</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the pension credit factor being applied, or(see PTM095200 for more detail)</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the member ceasing to accrue benefits under the scheme as a &#8216;non-resident&#8217; (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM095300:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM095300</remotelink> for more detail).</p></li><p>The same principle applies where dealing with factors relating to transitional protection issues, i.e. in the calculation of the pre-commencement pension credit factor (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM092200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM092200</remotelink> for more detail) and the primary protection factor (see PTM092300 for more detail).
