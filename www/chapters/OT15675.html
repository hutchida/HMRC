The ‘C’ factor is therefore the whole of the oil from the user field that is subjected to operations giving rise to qualifying tariff receipts of the participators.</p><sup>10</sup><p>For the calculation of TRA, see</p><sup>11</sup><p>OT15700 where the tariff relates to only part of the throughput and</p><sup>12</sup><p>OT15725 where there are participators in common in the principal and user fields.</p><sup>13</sup><p>The participators in the principal field may only receive one amount of TRA in respect of the qualifying tariff receipts from each user field.</p><sup>14</sup><p>In the case of BP Developments Ltd v CIR (64 TC 498), three tariffs were paid from Brae field to Forties field for three different operations, each using separate assets.
