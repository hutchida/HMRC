Where there had been a scheme transfer or merger in the year only one set of EOY information from one scheme was sent to BROCS (see</p><sup>2</sup><p>For each active contractor scheme found, automated checks were made to determine whether all expected returns for the tax year had been received and processed, with no exceptions that are likely to affect the EOY total tax deducted figure.
