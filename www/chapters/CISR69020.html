Where there had been a scheme transfer or merger in the year only one set of EOY information from one scheme was sent to BROCS (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CISR69030:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CISR69030</remotelink>).</p><p>For each active contractor scheme found, automated checks were made to determine whether all expected returns for the tax year had been received and processed, with no exceptions that are likely to affect the EOY total tax deducted figure.

It also showed the fact that this was an amendment to the original EOY total sent to BROCS by having an indicator of &#8216;Amendment&#8217; when this was sent across to BROCS.</p><h3>Multiple EOY Calculations sent on the same day</h3><p>Only one EOY calculation was sent to BROCS for the same scheme and tax year. Any further amendment to the first EOY calculation was sent as an automated EOY amendment request. Where multiple EOY calculations were received for the same scheme and tax year on the same day only one request was processed and treated as the EOY calculation.
