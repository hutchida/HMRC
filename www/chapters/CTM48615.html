It does not remove responsibility from the fund trustees or directors for ensuring that they have reasonable grounds for believing that a participant is entitled to payment without deduction. However, where the conditions are met in respect of a unit holder, payments must be made without deduction of tax.</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\CTM48615.xml</p><hr/><sup>0</sup><h3>Payment of interest distributions (for non-resident participants) to a reputable intermediary without deduction of tax - SI2006/964 Regulations 26 to 29</h3><sup>1</sup><p>Authorised investment funds must pay interest distributions in respect of an individual who is not ordinarily resident without deducting tax where the reputable intermediary test is satisfied in respect of the participant (beneficial owner of units/shares in the fund).
