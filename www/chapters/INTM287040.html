It will also need to check for itself whether there would be an obligation on a UK resident to deduct income tax if the payment had been made to a company resident in the State where the relevant PE is situated. It is not thought that this will present particular difficulties, but if companies do encounter real problems or uncertainties they should contact their corporation tax office as soon as the issue arises.</p><sup>3</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>4</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
