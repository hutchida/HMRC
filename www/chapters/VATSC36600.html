The Law Society, however, felt that there were several aspects of the settlement of disputes where VAT treatment is not straightforward and that further clarification was necessary. It was important that solicitors should be applying the correct principles and assurance from Customs and Excise with a view to giving agreed guidance to the profession would be welcome.</p><sup>3</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
