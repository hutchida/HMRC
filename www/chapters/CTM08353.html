The facts also show that the subsidiary did not have the resources to meet the payment itself. The sale documents are considered and do not connect the contribution to the sale, for example it is clear that the sale or indeed the sale price do not hinge on the contribution being made (though the pension liabilities/contributions etc may of course be mentioned).
