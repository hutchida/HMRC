Offshore transmission operators contract directly with the system operator, which is not a relevant public body. However, to secure a contract with the system operator, companies must go through several rounds of bidding in competition, involving sealed bids.</p><sup>10</sup><p>This tender is run by Ofgem; as such the contract between the system operator and the offshore transmission partner (although not having a relevant public body as party to it) will be a qualifying public contract.</p><sup>11</sup><h4>Example 2</h4><sup>12</sup><p>Under the Governments Feed In Tariff (FIT) scheme, companies receive payments with tariff rates set by the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS); these are for both generation (of electricity for the company’s own use) and export (into the national grid). For some generating installations, a company wishing to be part of the FIT scheme must obtain accreditation from Ofgem, acting on behalf of GEMA.</p><sup>13</sup><p>Whilst GEMA licenses a FIT company, and BEIS controls the tariffs it receives, the FIT company neither has a contract with a relevant public body, nor has it bid for a contract in an auction run by one. Therefore the contract with an energy supplier is not a qualifying public contract.</p><sup>14</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>15</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
