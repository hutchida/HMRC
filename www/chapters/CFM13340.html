It is more likely in practice that the interest rate on the loan will be reset at the end of each month, quarter, half-year or year. A company can still use an option product to hedge its interest rate risk in these circumstances. It can buy what is called an interest rate cap.</p><sup>2</sup><p>A cap consists of a series, or strip, of cash-settled options which can be exercised sequentially on set dates. The effect is that the company is guaranteed a maximum cost for its borrowing, but can still profit from a reduction in interest rates. A premium is payable.</p><sup>3</sup><h3>Example</h3><sup>4</sup><p>Sherflatt Ltd, an expanding unquoted company, arranges a £4 million 5-year loan from its bank in order to develop the business. The interest terms are 6-month LIBOR plus 0.5%, resetting every 6 months and payable in arrears. Funding costs are critical to the company’s business projections, and it does not want to have to pay more than 6.0%. But it anticipates that, in the medium to long term, interest rates will fall, and it does not want to be locked into a 6% rate. At the start of the loan, 6-month LIBOR is 5%, so it is paying 5.5%.</p><sup>5</sup><p>The company buys an interest rate cap from a bank (probably, but not necessarily, the bank advancing the loan), fixing the maximum borrowing rate at 6.0%. It pays the premium quoted by the bank. (This would usually be quoted as a percentage of the face value of the cap, £4 million.)</p><sup>6</sup><p>At the end of 6 months, LIBOR is 5.75%, so Sherflatt Ltd would pay 6.25% for its loan. It exercises its option, and the bank pays</p><sup>7</sup><p>(6.25% - 6.0%) x £4,000,000 x 6/12 = £5,000</p><sup>8</sup><p>so that the company is effectively paying interest at 6%.</p><sup>9</sup><p>At the end of 12 months, the interest rate on the company’s loan falls to 5.8%. The company therefore does not exercise its option, and borrows at 5.8% - and so on … up to the end of the 5 years.</p><sup>10</sup><p>An interest rate floor is a similar option product which allows an investor to hedge a deposit by being guaranteed a minimum rate of interest. In return for a premium, the option holder has the right, but not the obligation, to fix the interest rate on a notional deposit. The option is exercisable at agreed intervals, and is cash settled in the same way as an interest rate cap.</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\CFM13340.xml</p><hr/><sup>0</sup><h3>Using interest rate caps and floors</h3><sup>1</sup><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">In the example at</p><sup>2</sup><p>A cap consists of a series, or strip, of cash-settled options which can be exercised sequentially on set dates.
