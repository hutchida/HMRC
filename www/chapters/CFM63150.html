There is, however, no requirement for this to be a derivative contract, so it includes any derivative embedded in some other type of contract (which is treated as a relevant contract by virtue of S584, S585 or S586), or an instrument that is not accounted for as a derivative.</p><sup>4</sup><p>Furthermore, the exchange gain or loss must be brought into account for corporation tax purposes.
