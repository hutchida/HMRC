Joining a group payment arrangement is optional. Companies that enter into a group payment arrangement will be entering into a contract (the arrangement document) with the Commissioners for HMRC.</p><p>Each group of companies must decide what is right for them and whether they want to be part of an arrangement. The arrangement document enclosed with these notes sets out the terms and the way these arrangements will operate.</p><p>These notes provide more information on the terms and conditions for a group payment arrangement and how it is administered. The notes also clarify some of the more complex clauses, and provide (under &#8216;interpretation&#8217;) some explanations of the terms used.</p><p>The notes have no effect on the terms of the group payment arrangement itself. They are for guidance only and you should carefully consider the arrangement document itself before deciding to proceed. The terms of the group payment arrangement cannot be negotiated.</p><p>A group with an up to date returns and payment position will not normally have to concern itself with those provisions designed to help us recover tax in certain circumstances.</p><p>The group payment team will be glad to give you any further clarification that you may need.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM97440:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Group payment arrangements help groups with the payment of tax. The group can also allocate payments between the members of the group payment arrangement so mitigating any potential differential interest charge.</p><p>If any of the participating companies (see &#8216;interpretation&#8217; below) pay by instalments (under SI1998/3175) a group payment arrangement enables the group to:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>manage any uncertainty over the corporation tax liabilities of individual companies between the instalment due dates and the filing of the tax returns,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>nominate one company to pay each instalment in one amount on behalf of companies in a group.</p></li><p>A group payment arrangement does not alter the fact that each company is liable for its own corporation tax, although a group payment arrangement also makes the nominated company liable to discharge the CT liabilities of all the companies participating in that group payment arrangement. A group payment arrangement can apply both to companies whose liability is payable by instalments, and those whose liability is not payable by instalments. But note that a company that is not liable to pay its corporation tax liability by instalments does not become liable to do so simply by being a member of a group payment arrangement.</p><p>We will be prepared to enter into a group payment arrangement with you but this will be at our discretion. Circumstances in which we may not enter an arrangement include:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>You do not send us the completed and signed arrangement document at least one month before the first instalment payment is due for accounting periods to be covered by the group payment arrangement.</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>You enter the same company into more than one group payment arrangement for the same relevant accounting period.</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Not all the proposed participating companies have a relevant accounting period ending on the same date as that of the nominated company.</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Not all the proposed participating companies are up to date with their filing and payment obligations.</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>The 51% group relationship required by TMA70/S59F does not exist between the individual companies at the time the arrangement document is signed.</p></li><p>Subject to the possibility of termination the arrangement will apply to the first relevant accounting period and then to subsequent relevant accounting periods.</p><p>The standard arrangement document is structured around a period of account. This is any period not exceeding 12 months for which the nominated company draws up its accounts.</p><p>There may be cases where this causes problems. For instance, when the nominated company draws up an account for a period exceeding 12 months. This could happen where a group is taken over and required to bring its reporting date into line with the new parent.</p><p>An annex to the contract is available, which the group may be able to adopt if it wishes. The effect of the annex is to treat the long period of account as two periods of account for the purposes of the group payment arrangement. A copy of this annex may be obtained from the group payment team.</p><p>It is a condition of the contract that the nominated company is resident in the UK. We would usually expect this to be the case but, in practice, we are prepared to be flexible. We will consider requests where a group of companies liable to corporation tax want the nominated company to be a company resident in the European Union.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM97440:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>What you need to do</h3><p>If you decide to enter into a group payment arrangement with us, you must return the completed and signed arrangement document. You must enter on the relevant page the start and end dates of the first period to which you want the arrangement to apply.</p><p>Only include active companies in a group payment arrangement and provide their names in a schedule to the arrangement document. Any dormant companies, which start to trade or acquire some other source of income later, can join the arrangement at that time, subject to the conditions set out at clause 16.</p><p>Please check that you have provided all the relevant information by making appropriate entries in the arrangement document. These can be found on pages 1, 2, 7, 8, 10 and 11 and are indicated by a white box. Please also ensure that the schedule is fully completed and that a director of the nominated company signs and dates the arrangement document.</p><p>Do not complete the date on page one. We will fill this in.&#160;</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM97440:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>The group payment team</h3><p>There are two group payment teams, based at the Accounts Office in Shipley and Cumbernauld. Send the completed arrangement document to the Accounts Office to which the nominated company makes its tax payments. If you do not know this reference, or the nominated company has not previously made payments, contact the Inspector who deals with the group. Details of how to contact the group payment team are given at the end of this section. The group payment team will get in touch with you to confirm whether the group will be brought into the group payment arrangement scheme.</p><p>They will deal with all matters relating to the administration of the group payment arrangement, including repayments, apportionment, and changes to the membership of the group payment arrangement.</p><p>Where the group payment arrangement provides for anything to be done in writing to the nominated company the group payment team will do this. All agreements under the group payment arrangement, including the group payment arrangement itself, will be signed by the group payment team on behalf of the Board.</p><p>Where the group payment arrangement requires you to do anything in writing you should meet this requirement by writing to the appropriate group payment team.</p><p>In order to let us decide whether or not to enter into an arrangement with you the completed arrangement document must reach the group payment team no later than one month before the first instalment payment for the group is due. If we do not receive the document by then we cannot guarantee to reach a decision and enter into an arrangement in time for the relevant accounting period.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM97440:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>If we decide to enter into an arrangement</h3><p>A separate taxpayer reference will be allocated to the group payment arrangement and all payments under the arrangement should be made using this reference. We have seen a number of cases where a company has quoted the wrong reference, leading to payments being allocated automatically to the wrong period or to the record of the wrong company rather than the group record. This is not easy for us to spot and we cannot guarantee to correct such errors before the closing date (see &#8216;interpretation&#8217;)</p><p>All payments made for a group payment arrangement must be made by electronic funds transfer (CHAPS, BACS) or bank giro credit. Please indicate on the schedule to the arrangement document whether you intend to pay by BACS, CHAPS or bank giro credit. The group payment team will also give you details of how to make payments under the arrangement. If we make any repayments we will usually repay by BACS so you should also provide the relevant account name, number and bank sort code.</p><p>Group payment team<nl /> Banking Operations<nl /> St

The definitions themselves are not repeated in these notes - please refer to the group payment arrangement itself. Below is some additional material but note that it does not define the terms.</p><p>&#8216;Participating company&#8217; Not all companies in a group have to be in an arrangement or in the same arrangement.</p><p>The set of participating companies can change over time as companies join and leave the group. Clause 17 requires you to provide us with a list of the participating companies in relation to each period of account where there is a change from the previous period of account.</p><p>&#8220;Relevant accounting period&#8221; The arrangement document allows a company in a group to take part in a group payment arrangement if its accounting periods differ from the period of account under some circumstances.</p><p>This flexibility allows newly formed and newly acquired companies to be included within a group payment arrangement. It will also allow a company to remain within an arrangement if it proves to have more than one tax accounting period within a 12-month account due to the operation CTA2009/S9 and S10. (This may happen, for example, where a company ceases to trade during the period covered by its accounts and becomes an investment company.)</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM97440:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Clause 3</h3><h3>Payment obligations of the nominated company in relation to a period of account</h3><p>The nominated company undertakes to discharge the liabilities of the participating companies. They must be paid on the dates they become payable, or are treated by the Corporation Tax Instalment Regulations (1999) as becoming due and payable, by the participating companies, for the relevant accounting periods.</p><p>It is up to the nominated company to calculate the correct amount of payments due and to make sure these are made on the correct dates. The amount to be discharged by the nominated company will not be affected by changes to the liabilities of the participating companies occurring after the closing date.</p><p>So any increase in the liability of a participating company occurring after the closing date will be the responsibility of that company.

Joining a group payment arrangement is optional. Companies that enter into a group payment arrangement will be entering into a contract (the arrangement document) with the Commissioners for HMRC.</p><p>Each group of companies must decide what is right for them and whether they want to be part of an arrangement. The arrangement document enclosed with these notes sets out the terms and the way these arrangements will operate.</p><p>These notes provide more information on the terms and conditions for a group payment arrangement and how it is administered. The notes also clarify some of the more complex clauses, and provide (under &#8216;interpretation&#8217;) some explanations of the terms used.</p><p>The notes have no effect on the terms of the group payment arrangement itself. They are for guidance only and you should carefully consider the arrangement document itself before deciding to proceed. The terms of the group payment arrangement cannot be negotiated.</p><p>A group with an up to date returns and payment position will not normally have to concern itself with those provisions designed to help us recover tax in certain circumstances.</p><p>The group payment team will be glad to give you any further clarification that you may need.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_CTM97440:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Group payment arrangements help groups with the payment of tax. The group can also allocate payments between the members of the group payment arrangement so mitigating any potential differential interest charge.</p><p>If any of the participating companies (see &#8216;interpretation&#8217; below) pay by instalments (under SI1998/3175) a group payment arrangement enables the group to:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>manage any uncertainty over the corporation tax liabilities of individual companies between the instalment due dates and the filing of the tax returns,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>nominate one company to pay each instalment in one amount on behalf of companies in a group.</p></li><p>A group payment arrangement does not alter the fact that each company is liable for its own corporation tax, although a group payment arrangement also makes the nominated company liable to discharge the CT liabilities of all the companies participating in that group payment arrangement. A group payment arrangement can apply both to companies whose liability is payable by instalments, and those whose liability is not payable by instalments. But note that a company that is not liable to pay its corporation tax liability by instalments does not become liable to do so simply by being a member of a group payment arrangement.</p><p>We will be prepared to enter into a group payment arrangement with you but this will be at our discretion. Circumstances in which we may not enter an arrangement include:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>You do not send us the completed and signed arrangement document at least one month before the first instalment payment is due for accounting periods to be covered by the group payment arrangement.</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>You enter the same company into more than one group payment arrangement for the same relevant accounting period.</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Not all the proposed participating companies have a relevant accounting period ending on the same date as that of the nominated company.</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Not all the proposed participating companies are up to date with their filing and payment obligations.</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>The 51% group relationship required by TMA70/S59F does not exist between the individual companies at the time the arrangement document is signed.</p></li><p>Subject to the possibility of termination the arrangement will apply to the first relevant accounting period and then to subsequent relevant accounting periods.</p><p>The standard arrangement document is structured around a period of account. This is any period not exceeding 12 months for which the nominated company draws up its accounts.</p><p>There may be cases where this causes problems. For instance, when the nominated company draws up an account for a period exceeding 12 months. This could happen where a group is taken over and required to bring its reporting date into line with the new parent.</p><p>An annex to the contract is available, which the group may be able to adopt if it wishes. The effect of the annex is to treat the long period of account as two periods of account for the purposes of the group payment arrangement. A copy of this annex may be obtained from the group payment team.</p><p>It is a condition of the contract that the nominated company is resident in the UK. We would usually expect this to be the case but, in practice, we are prepared to be flexible. We will consider requests where a group of companies liable to corporation tax want the nominated company to be a company resident in the European Union.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_CTM97440:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>What you need to do</h3><p>If you decide to enter into a group payment arrangement with us, you must return the completed and signed arrangement document. You must enter on the relevant page the start and end dates of the first period to which you want the arrangement to apply.</p><p>Only include active companies in a group payment arrangement and provide their names in a schedule to the arrangement document. Any dormant companies, which start to trade or acquire some other source of income later, can join the arrangement at that time, subject to the conditions set out at clause 16.</p><p>Please check that you have provided all the relevant information by making appropriate entries in the arrangement document. These can be found on pages 1, 2, 7, 8, 10 and 11 and are indicated by a white box. Please also ensure that the schedule is fully completed and that a director of the nominated company signs and dates the arrangement document.</p><p>Do not complete the date on page one. We will fill this in.&#160;</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_CTM97440:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>The group payment team</h3><p>There are two group payment teams, based at the Accounts Office in Shipley and Cumbernauld. Send the completed arrangement document to the Accounts Office to which the nominated company makes its tax payments. If you do not know this reference, or the nominated company has not previously made payments, contact the Inspector who deals with the group. Details of how to contact the group payment team are given at the end of this section. The group payment team will get in touch with you to confirm whether the group will be brought into the group payment arrangement scheme.</p><p>They will deal with all matters relating to the administration of the group payment arrangement, including repayments, apportionment, and changes to the membership of the group payment arrangement.</p><p>Where the group payment arrangement provides for anything to be done in writing to the nominated company the group payment team will do this. All agreements under the group payment arrangement, including the group payment arrangement itself, will be signed by the group payment team on behalf of the Board.</p><p>Where the group payment arrangement requires you to do anything in writing you should meet this requirement by writing to the appropriate group payment team.</p><p>In order to let us decide whether or not to enter into an arrangement with you the completed arrangement document must reach the group payment team no later than one month before the first instalment payment for the group is due. If we do not receive the document by then we cannot guarantee to reach a decision and enter into an arrangement in time for the relevant accounting period.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_CTM97440:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>If we decide to enter into an arrangement</h3><p>A separate taxpayer reference will be allocated to the group payment arrangement and all payments under the arrangement should be made using this reference. We have seen a number of cases where a company has quoted the wrong reference, leading to payments being allocated automatically to the wrong period or to the record of the wrong company rather than the group record. This is not easy for us to spot and we cannot guarantee to correct such errors before the closing date (see &#8216;interpretation&#8217;)</p><p>All payments made for a group payment arrangement must be made by electronic funds transfer (CHAPS, BACS) or bank giro credit. Please indicate on the schedule to the arrangement document whether you intend to pay by BACS, CHAPS or bank giro credit. The group payment team will also give you details of how to make payments under the arrangement. If we make any repayments we will usually repay by BACS so you should also provide the relevant account name, number and bank sort code.</p><p>Corporate Treasury</p><p>GPA Team</p><p>HMRC</p><p>BX9

However, unless the group payment arrangement states otherwise, anything already done or deemed to have been done by the date of termination will not be affected by termination.</p><p>With respect to payments that have not already been repaid or apportioned then further apportionment can take place as follows. Any apportionment is subject to the rules on finality (clause 11) and the rule allowing us to charge a tax-related penalty (clause 12). If there is an outstanding claim for repayment (clause 4) we will consider this first before making any apportionment. If we apportion, or reapportion (clause 20(c) or (d)) neither the nominated company, nor any participating company, can amend our figures.</p><p>Once we have issued a notice under clause 19:</p><li><lilabel>1</lilabel><p>The nominated company has 30 days to apportion the payments.</p></li><li><lilabel>2</lilabel><p>If the nominated company does not apportion we have the right to nominate another participating company which has the right to apportion.
