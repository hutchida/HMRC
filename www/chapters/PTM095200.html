The ex-spouse&#8217;s or former civil partner&#8217;s lifetime allowance is enhanced by applying the pension credit factor. To qualify for a pension credit factor the following conditions must be met:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the pension credit is held in a registered pension scheme and was acquired on or after 6 April 2006, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>it&#8217;s derived from a pension benefit from the same or another registered pension scheme that was already in payment to the original member at the time of the pension sharing order, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the original member became entitled to that pension in payment on or after 6 April 2006.</p></li><p>No entitlement to a pension credit factor arises if an individual acquires pension credit rights on or after 6 April 2006 but those rights were derived from</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the pension of their ex-husband, ex-wife or former civil partner (the original member) that was in payment at the time of the pension sharing order but which came into payment before 6 April 2006, or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>rights held by that ex-husband, ex-wife or former civil partner (the original member) that had not been crystallised at the time of the pension sharing order.</p></li><h3>Calculating a pension credit factor</h3><p>Where an individual (an ex-spouse or former civil partner of a member) acquires pension credit rights derived from a pension already in payment to their ex-husband, ex-wife or former civil partner (the original member), whose entitlement to that pension in payment arose after 5 April 2006 (making it a post-commencement pension in payment), that pension will already have been tested for lifetime allowance purposes in relation to the original member&#8217;s lifetime allowance entitlement when the pension came into payment.</p><p>The lifetime allowance of the ex-spouse or former civil partner may be increased by an appropriate lifetime allowance enhancement factor to reflect the increased benefits provided by those pension credit rights. This ensures the pension credit rights (or the proportion of those rights attributable to a post-commencement pension in payment) are not tested again for lifetime allowance purposes when the ex-spouse or former civil partner crystallises those rights, this lifetime allowance enhancement factor is called the pension credit factor.</p><p>The pension credit factor is calculated by reference to the actual value of the pension credit rights derived from the pension in payment. The factor is the fraction of the standard lifetime allowance the relevant pension credit rights represented at the time the ex-spouse or former civil partner acquired those rights.</p><p>For example, if the pension credit rights are &#163;150,000 at the time they are acquired by the ex-spouse or former civil partner and the standard lifetime allowance at that time is &#163;1.5 million the pension credit factor is 0.1.</p><p>The pension credit factor is calculated by using the formula</p><p>APC/SLA</p><p>APC = the appropriate amount (see below for more detail) the pension credit rights attributable to a post commencement pension in payment represent</p><p>SLA = the standard lifetime allowance at the time when the rights are acquired.</p><p>The factor should go to two decimal places.&#160;This should be a rounded-up figure, so for example if the calculation produces a factor of 0.231 this becomes 0.24.</p><p>This factor is then applied to the standard lifetime allowance at any future BCE to provide the uplift to the individual&#8217;s lifetime allowance for the purpose of that BCE unless:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the pension credit factor was generated before 6 April 2012, in which case the uplift for BCEs occurring on or after 6 April 2012, is provided by applying the factor to the figure of &#163;1.8 million if this is more than the standard lifetime&#160;allowance. The uplift is then added to the standard lifetime allowance at the date of the BCE to arrive at the individual&#8217;s lifetime allowance, or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the pension credit factor was generated on or after 6 April 2012 but before&#160;6 April 2014, in which case the uplift for BCEs occurring on or after 6 April 2014, is provided by applying the factor to the figure of &#163;1.5 million if this is more than the standard lifetime allowance.
