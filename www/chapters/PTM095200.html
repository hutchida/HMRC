Notification should be made on form APSS 201 and normally received by HMRC no later than 5 years after 31 January following the tax year when the pension sharing order or provision took effect. So, for example, if an order took effect in the tax year 2015-16 the application should be made by 31 January 2022 at the latest. HMRC may accept a late notification in limited circumstances. See](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/pensions-tax-manual/ptm098000) for guidance on late notification.</p><sup>69</sup><p>HMRC will issue a certificate confirming the pension credit factor the individual is entitled to. HMRC will give each certificate its own reference number. The certificate is valid until such time as it is revoked or amended by HMRC. If after the claim has been made the individual learns that the information provided was incorrect, they must inform HMRC as soon as possible. If necessary, HMRC will then revoke the original certificate and issue an amended certificate, valid as above.</p></div></div></body></html>
