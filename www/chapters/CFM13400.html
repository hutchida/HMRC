If &#8364;100,000 could be bought in the spot market for &#163;64,800 when the invoice falls due for payment, the company will be worse off than if it hadn&#8217;t entered into the forward contract. On the other hand, if &#8364;100,000 turns out to be worth say &#163;65,500, the company could be better off. The important point is that by taking out the forward contract, the company has certainty. It knows in advance exactly how much, in sterling terms, it is going to have to pay and is protected from unpleasant surprises.</p><p>Currency options provide an alternative means of hedging exchange risk. In the above example, instead of entering into a forward contract to buy &#8364;100,000, the company might instead decide to buy a euro call option from its bank, giving it the right - but not the obligation - to buy &#8364;100,000 at a predetermined strike price.
