Where a scheme has been de-registered then the person(s) who was the scheme administrator immediately before the scheme was de-registered is responsible for filing the Event Report.</p><p>A practitioner can file the Event Report on behalf of the scheme administrator but the scheme administrator remains responsible for ensuring that it is submitted on time and the contents are correct. Where a practitioner submits the report the scheme administrator should have seen and approved the content of the Event Report before it is submitted to HMRC. The practitioner must make a declaration that the scheme administrator has approved the contents before they can submit it to HMRC.</p><p>The scheme administrator is liable for penalties if the Event Report is incomplete or inaccurate, including where they ask a practitioner to submit the report on their behalf.</p><p>The Registered Pension Schemes (Splitting of Schemes) Regulations 2006 - SI 2006/569</p><p>Where the registered pension scheme is a split scheme the sub-scheme administrator is responsible for filing the Event Report due for their sub-scheme.

If a pension scheme is registered and a reportable event has occurred in the tax year an Event Report must be submitted. If no reportable events have occurred in the tax year the scheme administrator does not need to send in an Event Report.</p><p>HMRC must receive the Event Report by 31 January after the end of the tax year to which the Event Report relates. Unless the registered pension scheme has wound up the Event Report cannot be filed before the end of the tax year.</p><p>If the Event Report is for the tax year ended 5 April 2014 the Event Report can be filed in the period 6 April 2014 to 31 January 2015. Where an Event Report is submitted late penalties may apply.</p><p>If a registered pension scheme has wound up, the deadline for filing the Event Report becomes three months after the scheme completed winding up. So if a scheme had events to report for the 2013-14 tax year, and the scheme wound up on 1 June 2014, the 2013-14 Event Report should be filed by 31 August 2014. An Event Report for 2014-15 (to cover the scheme wind up) will also need to be filed by 31 August 2014.</p><p>There is a different deadline for reporting</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>transfers to a qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme that were requested by the member after 5 April 2012 - see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM103050:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM103050</remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>becoming or ceasing to be a Master Trust scheme; this should be reported within 30 days.</p></li><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM161100:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>What happens if the Event Report is late or inaccurate</h3><p>Section 98 Taxes Management Act 1970</p><p>If the Event Report is not filed on time the scheme administrator will be liable to a penalty, currently up to &#163;300. Further penalties may be due where the Event Report still hasn&#8217;t been sent in after this penalty has been raised. The further penalty can currently be up to &#163;60 for every day that the Event Report is late. As soon as the Event Report is correctly filed no more extra daily penalties can be raised.</p><p>If the information in the Event Report is not correct the scheme administrator can be liable to a penalty for fraudulently or negligently making an incorrect return. This penalty can currently be up to &#163;3,000.</p><p>Scheme administrators can appeal against a penalty using form APSS 413.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM161100:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>How the Event Report must be submitted</h3><p>Regulations 4 and 6 The Registered Pension Schemes and Overseas Pension Schemes (Electronic Communication of Returns and Information) Regulations 2006 - SI 2006/570</p><p>With the exception of reports under</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>event 9 (transfer to a qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme) for transfers requested after 5 April 2012, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>event 20A (becoming or ceasing to be a Master Trust scheme)</p></li><p>the Event Report must be delivered electronically using Pension Schemes Online. The scheme administrator will not have met their obligation to file an Event Report until submission has been accepted by Pension Schemes Online. The legislation treats any paper Event Reports as not having been delivered.</p><p>There is a different process for reporting transfers to a qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme, where the transfer was requested after 5 April 2012. These transfers must be reported using form APSS 262 - Transferring UK tax-relieved pension assets - within 60 days of the transfer.</p><p>You can only submit one Event Report per scheme per year. The Guide to using the Online Service for scheme administrators and practitioners (gov.uk website) sets out the practical steps of filing an Event Report.</p><p>It is possible to compile the Event Report throughout the year and save it. However HMRC cannot see the content of an Event Report that has been compiled and saved, but not submitted. The Event Report must be submitted to meet the scheme administrator&#8217;s filing obligations. Just compiling, but not submitting an Event Report does not meet the obligation to file.</p><p>Once you have submitted the Event Report any changes you want to make to it will be an amendment. You can amend an Event Report using Pension Schemes Online after it has been submitted to HMRC.

Where a scheme has been de-registered then the person(s) who was the scheme administrator immediately before the scheme was de-registered is responsible for filing the Event Report.</p><p>A practitioner can file the Event Report on behalf of the scheme administrator but the scheme administrator remains responsible for ensuring that it is submitted on time and the contents are correct.

The practitioner must make a declaration that the scheme administrator has approved the contents before they can submit it to HMRC.</p><p>The scheme administrator is liable for penalties if the Event Report is incomplete or inaccurate, including where they ask a practitioner to submit the report on their behalf.</p><p>The Registered Pension Schemes (Splitting of Schemes) Regulations 2006 - SI 2006/569</p><p>Where the registered pension scheme is a split scheme the sub-scheme administrator is responsible for filing the Event Report due for their sub-scheme. The Registered Pension Schemes (Splitting of Schemes) Regulations 2006 specifies which schemes are split schemes, how they are split into sub-schemes and who the sub- scheme administrator is.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM161100:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>When the Event Report must be submitted</h3><p>HMRC will not send a notice telling the scheme administrators that an Event Report needs to be submitted. If a pension scheme is registered and a reportable event has occurred in the tax year an Event Report must be submitted. If no reportable events have occurred in the tax year the scheme administrator does not need to send in an Event Report.</p><p>HMRC must receive the Event Report by 31 January after the end of the tax year to which the Event Report relates. Unless the registered pension scheme has wound up the Event Report cannot be filed before the end of the tax year.</p><p>If the Event Report is for the tax year ended 5 April 2014 the Event Report can be filed in the period 6 April 2014 to 31 January 2015. Where an Event Report is submitted late penalties may apply.</p><p>If a registered pension scheme has wound up, the deadline for filing the Event Report becomes three months after the scheme completed winding up. So if a scheme had events to report for the 2013-14 tax year, and the scheme wound up on 1 June 2014, the 2013-14 Event Report should be filed by 31 August 2014. An Event Report for 2014-15 (to cover the scheme wind up) will also need to be filed by 31 August 2014.</p><p>There is a different deadline for reporting</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>transfers to a qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme that were requested by the member after 5 April 2012 - see PTM103050</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>becoming or ceasing to be a Master Trust scheme; this should be reported within 30 days.</p></li><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM161100:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>What happens if the Event Report is late or inaccurate</h3><p>Section 98 Taxes Management Act 1970</p><p>If the Event Report is not filed on time the scheme administrator will be liable to a penalty, currently up to &#163;300. Further penalties may be due where the Event Report still hasn&#8217;t been sent in after this penalty has been raised. The further penalty can currently be up to &#163;60 for every day that the Event Report is late. As soon as the Event Report is correctly filed no more extra daily penalties can be raised.</p><p>If the information in the Event Report is not correct the scheme administrator can be liable to a penalty for fraudulently or negligently making an incorrect return. This penalty can currently be up to &#163;3,000.</p><p>Scheme administrators can appeal against a penalty using form APSS 413.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM161100:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>How the Event Report must be submitted</h3><p>Regulations 4 and 6 The Registered Pension Schemes and Overseas Pension Schemes (Electronic Communication of Returns and Information) Regulations 2006 - SI 2006/570</p><p>With the exception of reports under</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>event 9 (transfer to a qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme) for transfers requested after 5 April 2012, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>event 20A (becoming or ceasing to be a Master Trust scheme)</p></li><p>the Event Report must be delivered electronically using Pension Schemes Online. The scheme administrator will not have met their obligation to file an Event Report until submission has been accepted by Pension Schemes Online. The legislation treats any paper Event Reports as not having been delivered.</p><p>There is a different process for reporting transfers to a qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme, where the transfer was requested after 5 April 2012. These transfers must be reported using form APSS 262 - Transferring UK tax-relieved pension assets - within 60 days of the transfer.</p><p>You can only submit one Event Report per scheme per year. The Guide to using the Online Service for scheme administrators and practitioners (gov.uk website) sets out the practical steps of filing an Event Report.</p><p>It is possible to compile the Event Report throughout the year and save it. However HMRC cannot see the content of an Event Report that has been compiled and saved, but not submitted. The Event Report must be submitted to meet the scheme administrator&#8217;s filing obligations. Just compiling, but not submitting an Event Report does not meet the obligation to file.</p><p>Once you have submitted the Event Report any changes you want to make to it will be an amendment. You can amend an Event Report using Pension Schemes Online after it has been submitted to HMRC. You will need to wait for 24 hours after the Event Report has been submitted before you can make amendments to that Event Report.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM161200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div></div></body></html>
