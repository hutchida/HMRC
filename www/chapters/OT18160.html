Disposals and acquisitions by ‘connected parties’ of OP and NP respectively are equally covered - the definition of ‘connected’ follows that in ICTA88\S839.</p><sup>5</sup><p>Likewise NP cannot have a deduction for the expenditure it incurs either on acquiring a field interest (OTA75\S3(4)(e), see OT09550) or on acquiring field assets on transfer. OA75\SCH4\PARA1 prevents a deduction for the cost of acquiring a field asset where someone else’s prior expenditure on the same asset is allowable for the field. (OTA83\S5(4) disapplies paragraph 1 generally, but retains it when expenditure on an asset does not constitute a tariff or disposal receipt in the hands of the seller.)</p><sup>6</sup><h4>Anti-Avoidance</h4><sup>7</sup><p>FA99\S98 ensures that a PRT charge remains on tariffs and disposal receipts in relation to the field where a disposal is effected by separating infrastructure from the field, (see OT15150).</p><sup>8</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>9</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
