However, given that basic principle, and the uncertainty surrounding out of court settlements prior to the issue of the Press Notice 82/87, it had seemed that HMCE were forcing taxpayers to go all the way through the courts and not to enter any settlement by way of compromise, in order to guarantee that any payment would not attract VAT. Customs and Excise had reviewed their policy in the light of the decision in the case of Whites Metal Company v CCE (LON/86/686Z, No 2400) where the VAT Tribunal had held that services were not supplied by a plaintiff to a defendant in reaching a settlement of an action in court.</p><sup>3</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>4</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
