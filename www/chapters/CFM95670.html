The company might, for example, have a poor credit history or the amount requested might seem excessive compared to the expected return on it.</p><sup>2</sup><p>The bank may still approve the loan but require a guarantee in the case of a default, whereby the guarantor will take over the debt from the original debtor. The guarantor is likely to receive a fee from the debtor in return for providing the guarantee and s385(6) ensures that this will be included as an item of income in the guarantorâ€™s tax-interest amount.</p><sup>3</sup><p>The provision is needed because the guarantor will not be party to a loan relationship on providing the guarantee and so this amount cannot be a relevant loan relationship credit. By contrast, the expense to the debtor arises from its loan relationship with the bank and so will be included in tax-interest as a relevant debit.</p><sup>4</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>5</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
