Where there is no UK presence, for example where an overseas insurer is dealing with their own affairs directly, or where they have an agent based elsewhere in the EU, you should ask for the records to be made available in the UK. Where this is not possible you could, as an alternative, ask for a selection of records to be posted to you. However, in exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to visit the premises of an overseas insurer or their EU-based agent. For example, requests for the production of prime records in the UK may cause serious logistical or financial difficulties. In this event you should make it clear that any visit to non-UK premises would be exceptional and that we reserve the right to require production of the records in the UK in the future. Two officers would normally be required to carry out the visit and, if the visit includes IT systems audit work, one officer would need to be from the Audit Service. Before any visit to an overseas country can take place we need the permission of the fiscal authority in that country and there is no guarantee that they will necessarily agree. In addition, there are different considerations for EU and non-EU visits. In the case of EU-based insurers or agents you should consider making a request under the Mutual Assistance Directives (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT08350:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">IPT08350</remotelink>).
