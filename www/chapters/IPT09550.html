If there is any risk of an assessment being out of time, the assessment should be made immediately, together with a suitable covering letter. Insurers need not make written appeals against payment as a precondition of the consideration of a remission because of misunderstanding or alleged incorrect advice. Enforcement action may need to be inhibited.

Do not feel inhibited from making considered judgments, displaying initiative or taking decisions, because of the responsibility of line managers to consider culpability in remission cases. Where a remission has been authorised, and the deficiency has been caused by Departmental error or negligence, the authorising officer should consider the provisions set out in Chapter 7 of Guidance A9-2 Revenue Losses.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT09500:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT09600:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>Where a claim of misunderstanding or allegation of incorrect advice has been made, although the case may be under consideration, it is important to bear in mind the time limits for issuing assessments: see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_IPT09125:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">IPT09125</remotelink>.
