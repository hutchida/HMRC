So the permitted maximum for a later suggestion is not reduced if the employee has previously received an exempt award for a different suggestion. The permitted maximum is arrived at in accordance with EIM06620 (encouragement awards) or EIM06630Â (financial benefit awards) irrespective of any award made for an earlier suggestion.</p><sup>2</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>3</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
