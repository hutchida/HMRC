The provision does not apply however if the &#8216;qualifying date&#8217; falls before 14 September 1983 or before the end of the field&#8217;s first chargeable period. </p><h3>Qualifying date</h3><p>FA84\\S113(4) defines &#8216;qualifying date&#8217; as whichever of the following dates is the earliest:</p><li><lilabel>1</lilabel><p>the date on which the company first becomes entitled to the benefit of a licence whose area includes some or all of the field,</p></li><li><lilabel>2</lilabel><p>the date on which an associated (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT13810:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT13810</remotelink>) company becomes so entitled,</p></li><li><lilabel>3</lilabel><p>where there is an illustrative agreement under OTA75\\SCH3\\PARA5 (see OT19400), the date the agreement was made or, if later, the date on which the licensee becomes so entitled.</p></li><p>The qualifying date is not the date the company becomes a participator. Entitlement typically crystallises on the date the sale agreement is concluded or on a later closing date specified in the agreement.
