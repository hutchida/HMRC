The amount that can be deducted against ring fence profits is subject to an upper limit of the amount of expenses referable to the straddling period that have been&#160;paid on or before 11 March 2008.

For example, Company B has a 12 month AP ending on 31 December 2008. As 2008 is a leap year, the relevant fraction is (31 + 29 + 11)/366 = 71/366. </p><p>Transitional rules on the introduction of FA04 changes to S75 are in CTM08010.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT21070:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT21075:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><h3>CTA09\\S1219, CTA10\\S303</h3><p>The restriction on deducting expenses of management in computing ring fence profits applies to APs ending on or after 12 March 2008.
