Broadly speaking, section 161 defines a payment as including a transfer of assets (either directly or indirectly) and any transfer of money&#8217;s worth.&#160;Section 161 also treats payments made by a scheme to a person connected to a scheme member (who is neither a member nor a sponsoring employer) as effectively a payment to that scheme member.</p><p>The reference&#160;to a payment&#160;&#8216;treated as made&#8217; reflects provisions under Finance Act 2004 where there is no actual payment but where an unauthorised payment is deemed to be made.&#160;Examples include&#160;the provisions regarding value shifting, the use of scheme assets and assignment.</p><p>The member payment charges apply not just to payments to a member but also to payments in respect of a member. For example, a transfer is a payment in respect of a member and so will potentially be caught by the member payment charges.</p><p>Liability to the member payment charges arises wherever the individual is resident.</p><p>Where a member has made a transfer to a qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme (QROPS) they can still be liable to the member payment charges if that scheme loses or gives up QROPS status after the transfer was made.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM113210:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>How the member payment charges work</h3><p>For the purposes of the member payment charges the &#8216;member payment provisions&#8217; apply to a payment made (or treated as made) by an RNUKS as if it was made from a registered pension scheme. So you&#160;need to consider each RNUKS payment and ask yourself if the payment was made from a registered pension scheme, what type of payment would it be and how would it be taxed?</p><p>For example a transfer from an RNUKS to a scheme that is neither a registered pension scheme nor a qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme would be subject to the unauthorised payments charge. This is because if the payment had been made from a registered pension scheme, the transfer would be an unauthorised payment (as the transfer could not be a recognised transfer).</p><p>Another example might be where the unauthorised payments charge may apply if benefits were paid to an RNUKS member before the normal minimum pension age. The payment of a pension before the age of 55 can give rise to an unauthorised payments charge if that payment would have been an unauthorised payment if it were made from a registered pension scheme. To determine whether or not it was an unauthorised payment all of the provisions that apply to registered pension schemes would need to be taken into account, including the provision concerning a member&#8217;s protected pension age (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM062200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM062200</remotelink>).</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM113210:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Definition of a relevant non-UK scheme</h3><p>Paragraphs 1(5) Schedule 34 and 51(3) Schedule 36 Finance Act 2004</p><p>A scheme is a relevant non-UK scheme (RNUKS) if it is not a registered pension scheme and if one or more of the following conditions are met:</p><li><lilabel>1</lilabel><p>migrant member relief (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM111200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM111200</remotelink>) has been given in respect of contributions paid to the scheme</p></li><li><lilabel>2</lilabel><p>transitional corresponding relief (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM111500:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM111500</remotelink>) has been given in respect of contributions paid to the scheme</p></li><li><lilabel>3</lilabel><p>contributions made to the scheme after 5 April 2006 by or on behalf of a member, or by an employer in respect of them, have received tax relief under a double taxation arrangement (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM111600:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM111600</remotelink>)</p></li><li><lilabel>4</lilabel><p>any member of the scheme has been exempt from liability to tax by virtue of section 307 ITEPA in respect of provision for retirement or death benefits made by the employer after 5 April 2006 when the scheme was an overseas pension scheme (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM112200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM112200</remotelink>), or</p></li><li><lilabel>5</lilabel><p>there has been a relevant transfer to the scheme at any time after 5 April 2006 when it was a qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM112100:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM112100</remotelink>).</p></li><p>A relevant transfer is a transfer made directly or indirectly to the scheme of funds representing accrued rights under another scheme that is either:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>a registered pension scheme, or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>another RNUKS.</p></li><p>An indirect transfer can occur where an individual&#8217;s funds are transferred to a RNUKS from another relevant non-UK scheme and those funds had previously been transferred by the individual from a registered pension scheme.</p><p>An indirect transfer can also occur if the country in which the transferring and receiving RNUKS are established and regulated allows funds to be transferred, or rolled over from another, into such a pension scheme via the individual whose rights are being transferred, and if the conditions associated with such a transfer are met.

Schedule 34 Finance Act 2004</p><p>Individuals who are liable to a member payment charge will need to declare that on their Self Assessment tax return for the tax year in which the member payment charge arises. If a member has not been issued with a notice to file a tax return they are bound by the normal obligation to notify HMRC of their chargeability to UK tax as soon as practicable.</p><p>Liability to the member payment charges arises wherever the individual is resident.</p><p>Most of the member payment charges will not be within the scope of, and will not be exempted or overridden by, any of the UK&#8217;s double taxation arrangements. Nor will the taxable property unauthorised payments charge (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM113220:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM113220</remotelink>) be subject to double taxation agreements. That is because they are not charges on income and so do not come within any of the articles in the treaties. The member payment charges that arise under sections 636A, 636B and 636C ITEPA are exceptions to this rule. As they are charges on pension income they are relievable under those of the UK&#8217;s double taxation agreements that provide for residence State taxation of such income.</p><p>If a payment subject to the member payment charges is not taxed in the UK due to the operation of a double taxation agreement, it is treated as a payment of pension and a &#8216;relevant withdrawal&#8217; under section 576A ITEPA.</p><p>Where an individual is liable to a member payment charge they can receive credit for foreign tax paid.

Broadly speaking, section 161 defines a payment as including a transfer of assets (either directly or indirectly) and any transfer of money&#8217;s worth.&#160;Section 161 also treats payments made by a scheme to a person connected to a scheme member (who is neither a member nor a sponsoring employer) as effectively a payment to that scheme member.</p><p>The reference&#160;to a payment&#160;&#8216;treated as made&#8217; reflects provisions under Finance Act 2004 where there is no actual payment but where an unauthorised payment is deemed to be made.&#160;Examples include&#160;the provisions regarding value shifting, the use of scheme assets and assignment.</p><p>The member payment charges apply not just to payments to a member but also to payments in respect of a member. For example, a transfer is a payment in respect of a member and so will potentially be caught by the member payment charges.</p><p>Liability to the member payment charges arises wherever the individual is resident.</p><p>Where a member has made a transfer to a qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme (QROPS) they can still be liable to the member payment charges if that scheme loses or gives up QROPS status after the transfer was made.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM113210:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>How the member payment charges work</h3><p>For the purposes of the member payment charges the &#8216;member payment provisions&#8217; apply to a payment made (or treated as made) by an RNUKS as if it was made from a registered pension scheme. So you&#160;need to consider each RNUKS payment and ask yourself if the payment was made from a registered pension scheme, what type of payment would it be and how would it be taxed?</p><p>For example a transfer from an RNUKS to a scheme that is neither a registered pension scheme nor a qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme would be subject to the unauthorised payments charge. This is because if the payment had been made from a registered pension scheme, the transfer would be an unauthorised payment (as the transfer could not be a recognised transfer).</p><p>Another example might be where the unauthorised payments charge may apply if benefits were paid to an RNUKS member before the normal minimum pension age. The payment of a pension before the age of 55 can give rise to an unauthorised payments charge if that payment would have been an unauthorised payment if it were made from a registered pension scheme. To determine whether or not it was an unauthorised payment all of the provisions that apply to registered pension schemes would need to be taken into account, including the provision concerning a member&#8217;s protected pension age (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM062200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM062200</remotelink>).</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM113210:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Definition of a relevant non-UK scheme</h3><p>Paragraphs 1(5) Schedule 34 and 51(3) Schedule 36 Finance Act 2004</p><p>A scheme is a relevant non-UK scheme (RNUKS) if it is not a registered pension scheme and if one or more of the following conditions are met:</p><li><lilabel>1</lilabel><p>migrant member relief (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM111200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM111200</remotelink>) has been given in respect of contributions paid to the scheme</p></li><li><lilabel>2</lilabel><p>transitional corresponding relief (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM111500:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM111500</remotelink>) has been given in respect of contributions paid to the scheme</p></li><li><lilabel>3</lilabel><p>contributions made to the scheme after 5 April 2006 by or on behalf of a member, or by an employer in respect of them, have received tax relief under a double taxation arrangement (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM111600:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM111600</remotelink>)</p></li><li><lilabel>4</lilabel><p>any member of the scheme has been exempt from liability to tax by virtue of section 307 ITEPA in respect of provision for retirement or death benefits made by the employer after 5 April 2006 when the scheme was an overseas pension scheme (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM112200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM112200</remotelink>), or</p></li><li><lilabel>5</lilabel><p>there has been a relevant transfer to the scheme at any time after 5 April 2006 when it was a qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM112100:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM112100</remotelink>).</p></li><p>A relevant transfer is a transfer made directly or indirectly to the scheme of funds representing accrued rights under another scheme that is either:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>a registered pension scheme, or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>another RNUKS.</p></li><p>An indirect transfer can occur where an individual&#8217;s funds are transferred to a RNUKS from another relevant non-UK scheme and those funds had previously been transferred by the individual from a registered pension scheme.</p><p>An indirect transfer can also occur if the country in which the transferring and receiving RNUKS are established and regulated allows funds to be transferred, or rolled over from another, into such a pension scheme via the individual whose rights are being transferred, and if the conditions associated with such a transfer are met.

Schedule 34 Finance Act 2004</p><p>Individuals who are liable to a member payment charge will need to declare that on their Self Assessment tax return for the tax year in which the member payment charge arises. If a member has not been issued with a notice to file a tax return they are bound by the normal obligation to notify HMRC of their chargeability to UK tax as soon as practicable.</p><p>Liability to the member payment charges arises wherever the individual is resident.</p><p>Most of the member payment charges will not be within the scope of, and will not be exempted or overridden by, any of the UK&#8217;s double taxation arrangements. Nor will the taxable property unauthorised payments charge (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM113220:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM113220</remotelink>) be subject to double taxation agreements. That is because they are not charges on income and so do not come within any of the articles in the treaties. The member payment charges that arise under sections 636A, 636B and 636C ITEPA are exceptions to this rule. As they are charges on pension income they are relievable under those of the UK&#8217;s double taxation agreements that provide for residence State taxation of such income.</p><p>If a payment subject to the member payment charges is not taxed in the UK due to the operation of a double taxation agreement, it is treated as a payment of pension and a &#8216;relevant withdrawal&#8217; under section 576A ITEPA.</p><p>Where an individual is liable to a member payment charge they can receive credit for foreign tax paid. The amount of any liability to UK tax imposed on that individual will be reduced by the amount of any tax paid in respect of that payment under the law of any country or territory outside the UK.</p><p>Should that individual pay the member payment charge, as well as pay tax in respect of the payment from the scheme at a later date under the law of any country or territory outside the UK, an appropriate adjustment will be made in the individual&#8217;s tax liability. Commonly, a discharge or repayment of UK tax will be made.</p><p>There are no specific rules dealing with benefits expressed in a foreign currency, but where a member payment charge arises it would be acceptable to calculate the tax payable by converting the benefits payment into sterling using the spot rate for the date of the payment.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM113220:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div></div></body></html>
