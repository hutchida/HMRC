Where the payment is a lump sum death benefit it is the recipient of that payment who is liable to pay the special lump sum death benefits charge. Schedule 34 Finance Act 2004 modifies the application of sections 205 and 206 Finance Act 2004 to remove tax liability from the scheme administrator and place it instead on the member or recipient of the lump sum death benefit.</p><sup>16</sup><p>The member payment charges apply to payments made, or treated as made, to or in respect of a:</p><sup>17</sup><p>of a relevant non-UK scheme (RNUKS) - see</p><sup>18</sup><p>Section 161 provides a wide definition to the term ‘payment’. Broadly speaking, section 161 defines a payment as including a transfer of assets (either directly or indirectly) and any transfer of money’s worth. Section 161 also treats payments made by a scheme to a person connected to a scheme member (who is neither a member nor a sponsoring employer) as effectively a payment to that scheme member.</p><sup>19</sup><p>The reference to a payment ‘treated as made’ reflects provisions under Finance Act 2004 where there is no actual payment but where an unauthorised payment is deemed to be made. Examples include the provisions regarding value shifting, the use of scheme assets and assignment.</p><sup>20</sup><p>The member payment charges apply not just to payments to a member but also to payments in respect of a member. For example, a transfer is a payment in respect of a member and so will potentially be caught by the member payment charges.</p><sup>21</sup><p>Liability to the member payment charges arises wherever the individual is resident.</p><sup>22</sup><p>Where a member has made a transfer to a qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme (QROPS) they can still be liable to the member payment charges if that scheme loses or gives up QROPS status after the transfer was made.</p><sup>23</sup><h3>How the member payment charges work</h3><sup>24</sup><p>For the purposes of the member payment charges the ‘member payment provisions’ apply to a payment made (or treated as made) by an RNUKS as if it was made from a registered pension scheme. So you need to consider each RNUKS payment and ask yourself if the payment was made from a registered pension scheme, what type of payment would it be and how would it be taxed?</p><sup>25</sup><p>For example a transfer from an RNUKS to a scheme that is neither a registered pension scheme nor a qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme would be subject to the unauthorised payments charge. This is because if the payment had been made from a registered pension scheme, the transfer would be an unauthorised payment (as the transfer could not be a recognised transfer).</p><sup>26</sup><p>Another example might be where the unauthorised payments charge may apply if benefits were paid to an RNUKS member before the normal minimum pension age. The payment of a pension before the age of 55 can give rise to an unauthorised payments charge if that payment would have been an unauthorised payment if it were made from a registered pension scheme. To determine whether or not it was an unauthorised payment all of the provisions that apply to registered pension schemes would need to be taken into account, including the provision concerning a member’s protected pension age (see</p><sup>27</sup><h3>Definition of a relevant non-UK scheme</h3><sup>28</sup><p>Paragraphs 1(5) Schedule 34 and 51(3) Schedule 36 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>29</sup><p>A scheme is a relevant non-UK scheme (RNUKS) if it is not a registered pension scheme and if one or more of the following conditions are met:</p><sup>30</sup><p>migrant member relief (see</p><sup>31</sup><p>transitional corresponding relief (see</p><sup>32</sup><p>contributions made to the scheme after 5 April 2006 by or on behalf of a member, or by an employer in respect of them, have received tax relief under a double taxation arrangement (see</p><sup>33</sup><p>any member of the scheme has been exempt from liability to tax by virtue of section 307 ITEPA in respect of provision for retirement or death benefits made by the employer after 5 April 2006 when the scheme was an overseas pension scheme (see</p><sup>34</sup><p>there has been a relevant transfer to the scheme at any time after 5 April 2006 when it was a qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme (see</p><sup>35</sup><p>A relevant transfer is a transfer made directly or indirectly to the scheme of funds representing accrued rights under another scheme that is either:</p><sup>36</sup><p>a registered pension scheme, or</p><sup>37</sup><p>another RNUKS.</p><sup>38</sup><p>An indirect transfer can occur where an individual’s funds are transferred to a RNUKS from another relevant non-UK scheme and those funds had previously been transferred by the individual from a registered pension scheme.</p><sup>39</sup><p>An indirect transfer can also occur if the country in which the transferring and receiving RNUKS are established and regulated allows funds to be transferred, or rolled over from another, into such a pension scheme via the individual whose rights are being transferred, and if the conditions associated with such a transfer are met.
