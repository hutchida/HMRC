The legislation makes separate provision for debits (s383) and credits (s386) but these sections are similar in nature. They define a relevant loan relationship debit or credit as any amount that would be brought into account under the loan relationship provisions, whether by CTA09/PT3 or CTA09/PT5, unless it is an excluded amount.</p><sup>3</sup><h4>Exchange gains and losses</h4><sup>4</sup><p>A loan relationship debit or credit will be excluded if it is in respect of an exchange gain or loss.</p><sup>5</sup><h4>Impairment losses and reversals</h4><sup>6</sup><p>Debits will also be excluded if they arise from an impairment loss, and symmetry is ensured by also excluding credits which arise from the reversal of a previous impairment.</p></div></body></html>
