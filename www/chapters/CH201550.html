The Comp1 was introduced on 2 July 2012 and enables customers to temporarily appoint a tax adviser to deal with their tax affairs in relation to a compliance check.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Before we can deal directly with a tax adviser, for example an accountant or agent, during a compliance check, a valid and specific authorisation needs to be in place. This allows compliance officers to deal with the adviser in respect of the taxes covered by the authorisation.</p><p>Customers can currently authorise an adviser (either online or on form 64-8, or for CITEX a letter of authority for the agent to act) to deal with HMRC for their day-to-day matters, see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CH201500:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CH201500</remotelink>.</p><p>If we already hold a formal agent authorisation and it covers all matters that are being checked, then this will cover the compliance check and no further authorisation will be needed. But, if an existing authorisation doesn&#8217;t cover all the matters we are checking, then further authorisation will be needed.</p><p>In response to feedback from staff and tax advisers, the Comp1 was developed so that customers can temporarily appoint a tax adviser to act for them during a compliance check. The Comp1 allows the customer to appoint an adviser to deal with all aspects of that compliance check.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CH201550:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>When the Temporary Authorisation form Comp1 can be used</h3><p>The Comp1 relates only to the appointment of an adviser to deal with a compliance check. It does not authorise us to deal with that adviser for anything outside that check. Form Comp1 does not replace or amend any existing authorisation made using form 64-8 or the online authorisation facility, or in CITEX cases a letter giving authority for the agent to act.</p><p>The temporary authorisation can be used to:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>extend an existing authorisation, for example where there is an adviser acting for one tax under a form 64-8, and the customer wants that adviser to act for more taxes just for the purpose of the compliance check</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>appoint an adviser to deal solely with the compliance check where there is no existing adviser authorisation</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>appoint a &#8216;specialist&#8217; tax adviser, for example in Specialist Investigation cases, just to deal with a compliance check. In such cases this will allow the existing adviser to continue to act for the customer in their day to day tax matters.</p></li><p>If, during the compliance check, the customer wants to cancel the temporary authorisation that they have made on a Comp1, they can do so verbally. Where possible the caseworker should also obtain written confirmation, although this is not essential.</p><p>If, during the compliance check, the customer wishes to change the temporary authorisation they have made on a Comp1, they will need to submit a new Comp1.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CH201550:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Guidance and access to form and advice on usage for customers</h3><p>The new Comp1 form is available on <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_HTTP:__WWW.HMRC.GOV.UK_AGENTS_INDEX:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">the Tax agents and advisers pages (HMRC Website)</remotelink>.
