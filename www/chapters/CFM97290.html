It is a QIC and has been since 1 January 2019. An election is made with effect from 1 January 2020 for it to become a member of the A, B and C joint infrastructure election under s435.</p><sup>5</sup><p>Companies C and D wish to revoke their elections to be QICs at the same time. Without the effect of s435, the earliest this could have effect from is 1 January 2024 (the beginning of the accounting period starting five years after Company D’s election to be a QIC).</p><sup>6</sup><p>As the majority of the members of the joint infrastructure election under s435 have had their election to be a QIC in effect for a period of five years at 31 December 2022, Company C and D may revoke their election to be a QIC with effect from 1 January 2023.</p><sup>7</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>8</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
