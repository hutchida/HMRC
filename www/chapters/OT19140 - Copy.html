                    version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>&#160;</p><p>The following paper was issued to
                    UKOITC (The United Kingdom Oil Industry Taxation Committee, formed in 1965) and
                    BRINDEX on 2 July 1991.</p><h3>Purpose of this Paper</h3><p>This paper was
                    produced in order to update the instructions and guidance given to inspectors
                    within OTO. A copy of it has been supplied to UKOITC and Brindex for the help
                    and guidance of their members.</p><h3>Why reconciliations are needed</h3><p>For
                    most of the taxes dealt with by the Inland Revenue it is not normal to adopt an
                    audit approach to tax returns. Rather computations are submitted by taxpayers
                    based on accounts. In the case of companies of the size dealt with by the Oil
                    Taxation Office these will often be accounts which have been subjected to
                    internal audit and external audit on an ongoing basis. Because of the structure
                    of the PRT legislation however, particularly that part relating to the allowance
                    of expenditure, most expenditure claims are submitted, examined and determined
                    long before accounts covering the claim period are available. Returns of
                    incomings for PRT purposes are also made ahead of audited financial accounts. As
                    regards expenditure, and particularly at the first claim stage, OTO&#8217;s
                    examination methods involve some inspection of basic records and consideration
                    of accounting systems, but it has always been recognised that this process falls
                    well short of a full audit and the OTO would need further reassurance as to the
                    accuracy of PRT claims and returns. This can only be achieved by a
                    reconciliation of those claims and returns with the audited accounts and CT
                    computations when they become available.</p><p>For PRT as with any tax there
                    will always be some items of income and occasionally some items of expenditure
                    where the taxability or allowability of the payment may be in doubt. Within the
                    context of CT it is possible for an Inspector to see from the accounts that
                    there has been a receipt which has been treated as non-taxable. The sort of
                    items that are in mind are insurance receipts, compensation payments, recoveries
                    from partners of payments made earlier. Where there is doubt as to whether these
                    items should be taken into account for PRT purposes it will not be apparent to
                    the Inspector who deals with the expenditure claim that the taxpayer may have
                    taken the benefit of the doubt and claimed the gross payment or left out an item
                    from the return of receipts. This may be a perfectly proper course of action but
                    the Inspector is not in a position to consider the technical merits of the
                    decision that has been taken unless he or she is aware of the item concerned.
                    Companies should be encouraged to provide details of such receipts
                    spontaneously. However where they do not do so the PRT/Accounts reconciliation
                    will disclose the existence of such receipts and provide the opportunity for the
                    Inspector who deals with the claims to consider the technical merits of the
                    company&#8217;s view.</p><p>As was considered above it is common for a field
                    that is assessed up to date and in particular for one that is paying tax for
                    claims to be made in advance of submission of related accounts and CT
                    computations. The same will be true of a field which surrenders CFA. By contrast
                    in the early years of development of a field (other than a donor of CFA) claims
                    for expenditure relief under Schedules 5 and 6 may be made many years after the
                    related accounts and CT computations have been submitted. Equally, where a
                    taxpayer incurs exploration, appraisal or research expenditure but has no or
                    limited PRT-liable field interests, claims for relief under Schedule 7 may not
                    be made until many years have elapsed since the expenditure was incurred. In
                    these circumstance there is no good reason why decisions should be taken on
                    claims unless they can be seen to reconcile back to the accounts and
                    computations that the OTO already hold. Similarly, in view of the long periods
                    involved in the development of most fields claims for the early years should in
                    future be submitted together with reconciliations as a matter of course and it
                    will increasingly become the practice of OTO not to take decisions on such
                    claims until they have been reconciled to the earlier accounts and CT
                    computations.</p><p>It may be the case that within the OTO a different Inspector
                    deals with the field and the CT computation. The Inspector dealing with the CT
                    will take overall responsibility for PRT/Accounts reconciliations and if a claim
                    is received for a back year the Inspector examining the claim will not take a
                    decision on it without first consulting the Inspector responsible for the
                    reconciliation. It would help this process if claims would identify the schedule
                    within reconciliations where the expenditure unclaimed is
                    recorded.</p><h3>OTO&#8217;s aim</h3><p>OTO&#8217;s aim is to obtain a
                    reconciliation of claims and returns to accounts and computations for every
                    producer and for every year in which that producer is involved in the North Sea.
                    For the future it will be the aim to receive the reconciliations together with
                    the CT computations in line with the target dates set by pay and file. Indeed
                    for a company masking PRT expenditure claims a reconciliation should henceforth
                    be regarded as an integral part of the CT computation. It is recommended that
                    there are in many cases a substantial number of back years for which
                    reconciliations still need to be provided. In some cases it may be necessary to
                    adopt a different standard of reconciliation for these earlier years in order to
                    clear the backing. Wherever possible and in particular where it can be seen that
                    little or no tax is at risk, OTO will adopt a pragmatic approach to the need to
                    clear reconciliations for early years.</p><p>The primary course of the
                    reconciliation is to provide a check on PRT not on CT so CT appeals should not
                    be kept open solely because reconciliations are outstanding. However Inspectors
                    have found the analysis in reconciliations helpful in examining CT computations
                    and there have been instances of errors in CT computations being discovered in
                    the course of performing the PRT/Accounts reconciliation.</p><p>Companies that
                    have not submitted reconciliations should be encouraged to supply details of the
                    dates by which they expect to supply reconciliations. If companies are reluctant
                    to supply timetables or if having done so they fall behind schedule careful
                    consideration should be given to what action is appropriate on OTO&#8217;s part
                    taking into account all relevant facts. Depending on the circumstances it may be
                    necessary to defer taking decisions on claims until reconciliations are
                    received.</p><p>It is important that when companies are taken over or when a
                    field interest is sold, the purchaser retains access to all the information
                    needed to produce outstanding reconciliations and to analyse expenditure shown
                    as unclaimed on reconciliations that have been received. If we are involved in
                    any pre-transaction clearances the opportunity should be taken to draw attention
                    to the need to retain access to old record.</p><h3>The accounts and CT
                    computations</h3><p>Before considering the reconciliation to the accounts it is
                    convenient to consider the information that ideally should be provided in the CT
                    computations. UK incorporated companies will submit audited accounts and in
                    nearly all cases non UK incorporated companies will also provide audited
                    accounts. In any case where a company declines to submit audited accounts OTO
                    will need to consider with the company whether the accounts submitted are
                    adequate for tax purposes, the company&#8217;s reasons for not submitting
                    audited accounts, and possibly further measures by way of inspection of primary
                    accounting records that may be needed on an ongoing basis. If extra resources
                    are needed to examine claims and computations from companies that do not produce
                    audited accounts this may lead to some delay in the taking of
                    decisions.</p><p>The starting point for the computations should be an analysis
                    of the movement on the fixed asset accounts between the opening and closing
                    balances of the year of both tangible and intangible assets. The movement should
                    be broken down on a field by field basis and also within each field by reference
                    to capital allowance categories. Non field expenditure, in particular
                    exploration, should be analysed by block or by license wherever possible
                    highlighting in particular areas which are close to development. It should also
                    be the aim to analyse operating expenditure on a field by field basis as well as
                    between internal categories and the allocation of any head office costs, parent
                    company costs or research and development into the company and/or into fields
                    should also be shown.</p><p>Receipts such as compensation and insurance receipts
                    should be identified. They may not appear in the profit and loss account but may
                    be treated as adjustments to fixed assets accounts that is as credits to those
                    accounts. These items need to be identified so that the gross expenditure on the
                    fixed asset account can be reconciled with expenditure claims. When such items
                    are identified in the computations by Inspectors dealing with CT they should
                    report them to the Inspector dealing with the particular field or other affected
                    area of claim for consideration. Miscellaneous receipts should be reported in a
                    similar fashion (e.g. receipts arising out of exploration or
                    research).</p><h3>The reconciliation</h3><p>The reconciliation should take
                    account of incomings to identify all receipts and reconcile them to the PRT1. In
                    particular S493 adjustments should be recorded between the CT accounts and the
                    PRT returns and tariff receipts and chargeable disposal receipts also need to be
                    identified.</p><p>The format of the reconciliation is a matter for the
                    particular company but it should provide all the information set out below.
                    Companies should be encouraged to supply only a reconciliation of the accounts
                    to claims and refrain from providing the intermediate stages that the company
                    needs to go through such as reconciliations to trial balances and billings.
                    Operators will however be expected to provide reconciliations between Schedule 5
                    claims and billings to all other participators in fields for which they are
                    operator. OTO will consider operators performance in this area in any review of
                    the suitability of a particular operator to act as responsible person.</p><p>A
                    reconciliation which amalgamates several years may be acceptable in clearing
                    arrears where little or no tax is at stake. This may be in situations where it
                    is accepted that there is little likelihood of there being any tax payable in
                    respect of the field, in situations where expiry of time limits is not likely to
                    be a factor because the periods terminate before the first claim period for any
                    affected field ends, and in circumstances where the expenditure is clearly seen
                    to be in a period where the field is pre-pay back. It will still be necessary to
                    have a more detailed year by year analysis and consideration of accruals around
                    the period at which a field approaches pay back. Because Sch 7 claims are always
                    intended to be tax effective it will be necessary to reconcile them on an annual
                    basis.</p><p>The reconciliation should be designed to tie the expenditure in the
                    accounts which has already been analysed on a field by field basis back to
                    identified expenditure claims under Schedule 5 and Schedule 6. There should also
                    be a full reconciliation of exploration expenditure and any research and
                    development as analysed in the accounts and computations back to the Schedule 7
                    claims. The analysis of claims should identify the claim numbers agreed with the
                    OTO and if that information is not available the date of the claim.</p><p>The
                    reconciliation should identify unclaimable expenditure in particular terms such
                    as interest, depreciation, onshore exploration and buildings. Expenditure on
                    exempt gas fields also needs to be separately identified. This is necessary so
                    that it can be seen that none of this expenditure has unwittingly franked claims
                    that have been made. Inspectors should look for negative amounts in this
                    expenditure analysis as these may indicate receipts which have been ignored for
                    PRT purposes.</p><p>If the reconciliation reveals over claims they should be
                    explicitly identified when the reconciliation is presented to OTO. (See also
                    Examination of the Reconciliations below).</p><p>There will be a residue of
                    expenditure which is in principle claimable for PRT purposes but has not yet
                    been claimed. This will relate to fields under development, and similar
                    prospects and also unutilised exploration expenditure where the taxpayer has no
                    need of Schedule 7 claims. It is important that this expenditure is analysed to
                    the extent that is possible when the reconciliation is prepared. This will
                    enable future claims to be checked against this analysis and avoid a further
                    reconciliation. It will be useful if an ongoing memorandum of unclaimed amounts
                    is submitted each year with the reconciliation for the latest year showing the
                    unclaimed amounts of earlier years updated by claims made since the previous
                    reconciliation.</p><p>OTO does not recognise as a general principle that there
                    may be a setting off of over claims against &#8220;under claims&#8221;.
                    Companies are not obliged to claim expenditure and OTO cannot be involved in
                    considering whether an &#8220;under claim&#8221; arose as a result of deliberate
                    policy or as a result of error. In considering culpability in relation to over
                    claims OTO will not as a matter of principle accept the offsetting of over
                    claims with &#8220;under claims&#8221; but a flexible approach will be taken in
                    setting particular cases and regard will always be had to all of the
                    circumstances and the merits of the particular case before forming a view on
                    culpability.</p><p>Where the company is not the operator for a field it will
                    probably have unrecognisable differences because of differences in exchange rate
                    policies and accruals. The resolution of such problems will be dealt with on a
                    case by case basis. Inspectors will need to consider carefully explanations put
                    forward and exercise judgement in reaching agreement with companies. Similarly
                    the reconciliation may include amounts described as unclaimed amounts. These may
                    constitute over claims. And accounts expenditure may need to be increased in the
                    course of the reconciliation by various adjustments to make the figures
                    reconcile. Inspectors will need to consider such adjustments critically. It
                    would help the process of reconciliation and the examination of claims if
                    companies would, when making claims, always specifically identify and give the
                    reasons for negative items of expenditure included within claims.</p><p>It will
                    be necessary to analyse the turnover in the accounts between arm&#8217;s length
                    and non arm&#8217;s length sales in order to agree adjustments under S493. If
                    this analysis is provided before final agreement of valuation issues has taken
                    place it is possible that they may be changes in the designation of sales from
                    arm&#8217;s length to non arm&#8217;s length. It may be necessary therefore to
                    check that the analysis is agreed. Errors in this area are likely to operate
                    against the taxpayer&#8217;s interest.</p><p>In certain circumstances, the OTO
                    will agree to examine &#8216;informal&#8217; claims, particularly those relating
                    to Schedule 7 expenditure. This procedure enables a company to submit details of
                    allowable expenditure without, in the case of Schedule 7 claims, specifying the
                    field of claim or period for allowance until a formal claim is submitted. The
                    procedure operates on the basis that the same care is required for an informal
                    as for a formal claim, and that the latter must specify the exact items being
                    claimed from any formal &#8216;pool&#8217;. The reconciliation should be to the
                    informal claim, which will normally be based on accounting periods. Where
                    subsequent formal claims have been made they will already be reconciled to the
                    informal claim.</p><h3>Examination of the Reconciliations</h3><p>The fact that
                    reconciliations have been received in OTO should be taken into account by each
                    Inspector with PRT responsibilities for the taxpayer and for each field in which
                    the company is a participator in examining claims.</p><p>It is expected that the
                    first reconciliations that are received from any company will need the most
                    careful examination. Inspectors will need to satisfy themselves that the
                    reconciliation has been competently performed and that all matters that need to
                    be considered have been considered. It will be necessary for the Inspector to
                    inform himself as to the detailed way in which the reconciliation has been
                    completed and presented. Provided the method of doing the reconciliation remains
                    consistent it is to be anticipated that future reconciliations will be agreed
                    more readily. The greatest value in reconciliations will therefore have been
                    achieved by the time the reconciliation is completed. By that time companies
                    will probably have made any further claims that they feel they ought to have
                    made and they will have notified OTO individually of over claims as they have
                    been identified.</p><p>Paragraph 9 Schedule 2 OTA 1975 provides that where any
                    return statement, declaration or accounts as are mentioned in Paragraph 8
                    Schedule 2 were made or submitted by any person neither fraudulently nor
                    negligently and it comes to his notice those were incorrect then, unless the
                    error is remedied without unreasonable delay, the return statement, declaration
                    or account shall be treated as having been negligently made or submitted by the
                    first mentioned person. It is important therefore that as companies discover
                    errors or over claims in the course of performing the reconciliations they bring
                    them to OTO&#8217;s attention immediately without waiting for completion of the
                    reconciliation. This will ensure that in cases where the original error was not
                    one arising from negligence that Para 9 does not operate to treat it as
                    such.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>It is accepted that a totally balanced
                    reconciliation will often prove difficult to achieve. Whatever method a company
                    uses most exercises will finish with an unexplained difference. As far as seems
                    reasonable, having regard to the amount of the difference both in absolute terms
                    and in relation to total expenditure, the company should endeavour to establish
                    the reason or likely reason for the difference. In the final analysis it is a
                    matter for judgement at what point and level an unexplained difference should be
                    accepted. Clearly a difference representing excess PRT claimed expenditure over
                    CT expenditure gives OTO more cause for concern than the reverse situation. It
                    is in fact more likely on the evidence of completed reconciliations seen that
                    the company will uncover PRT claimable but unclaimed expenditure as a result of
                    the exercise. Additional expenditure claims submitted in these circumstances
                    will be subjected to careful examination. Where for time limit reasons such an
                    additional claim is submitted before submission and examination of the
                    reconciliation concerned, examination of the PRT claim may need to be deferred
                    until the reconciliation is submitted and examined.</p><p>When further claims
                    are made as a result of a reconciliation it is not enough for a company to
                    identify the existence of unclaimed amounts. There may have been good reason for
                    not claiming the expenditure. Thus claims arising from a reconciliation must
                    identify the nature of the expenditure and demonstrate that it is allowable in
                    the particular field or under Schedule
                            7.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02"

                    reconciliations are needed</h3><p>For most of the taxes dealt with by the Inland
                    Revenue it is not normal to adopt an audit approach to tax returns. Rather
                    computations are submitted by taxpayers based on accounts. In the case of
                    companies of the size dealt with by the Oil Taxation Office these will often be
                    accounts which have been subjected to internal audit and external audit on an
                    ongoing basis. Because of the structure of the PRT legislation however,
                    particularly that part relating to the allowance of expenditure, most
                    expenditure claims are submitted, examined and determined long before accounts
                    covering the claim period are available. Returns of incomings for PRT purposes
                    are also made ahead of audited financial accounts. As regards expenditure, and
                    particularly at the first claim stage, OTO&#8217;s examination methods involve
                    some inspection of basic records and consideration of accounting systems, but it
                    has always been recognised that this process falls well short of a full audit
                    and the OTO would need further reassurance as to the accuracy of PRT claims and
                    returns. This can only be achieved by a reconciliation of those claims and
                    returns with the audited accounts and CT computations when they become
                    available.</p><p>For PRT as with any tax there will always be some items of
                    income and occasionally some items of expenditure where the taxability or
                    allowability of the payment may be in doubt. Within the context of CT it is
                    possible for an Inspector to see from the accounts that there has been a receipt
                    which has been treated as non-taxable. The sort of items that are in mind are
                    insurance receipts, compensation payments, recoveries from partners of payments
                    made earlier. Where there is doubt as to whether these items should be taken
                    into account for PRT purposes it will not be apparent to the Inspector who deals
                    with the expenditure claim that the taxpayer may have taken the benefit of the
                    doubt and claimed the gross payment or left out an item from the return of
                    receipts. This may be a perfectly proper course of action but the Inspector is
                    not in a position to consider the technical merits of the decision that has been
                    taken unless he or she is aware of the item concerned. Companies should be
                    encouraged to provide details of such receipts spontaneously. However where they
                    do not do so the PRT/Accounts reconciliation will disclose the existence of such
                    receipts and provide the opportunity for the Inspector who deals with the claims
                    to consider the technical merits of the company&#8217;s view.</p><p>As was
                    considered above it is common for a field that is assessed up to date and in
                    particular for one that is paying tax for claims to be made in advance of
                    submission of related accounts and CT computations. The same will be true of a
                    field which surrenders CFA. By contrast in the early years of development of a
                    field (other than a donor of CFA) claims for expenditure relief under Schedules
                    5 and 6 may be made many years after the related accounts and CT computations
                    have been submitted. Equally, where a taxpayer incurs exploration, appraisal or
                    research expenditure but has no or limited PRT-liable field interests, claims
                    for relief under Schedule 7 may not be made until many years have elapsed since
                    the expenditure was incurred. In these circumstance there is no good reason why
                    decisions should be taken on claims unless they can be seen to reconcile back to
                    the accounts and computations that the OTO already hold. Similarly, in view of
                    the long periods involved in the development of most fields claims for the early
                    years should in future be submitted together with reconciliations as a matter of
                    course and it will increasingly become the practice of OTO not to take decisions
                    on such claims until they have been reconciled to the earlier accounts and CT
                    computations.</p><p>It may be the case that within the OTO a different Inspector
                    deals with the field and the CT computation. The Inspector dealing with the CT
                    will take overall responsibility for PRT/Accounts reconciliations and if a claim
                    is received for a back year the Inspector examining the claim will not take a
                    decision on it without first consulting the Inspector responsible for the
                    reconciliation. It would help this process if claims would identify the schedule
                    within reconciliations where the expenditure unclaimed is
                        recorded.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04"
                        refpt="0Y04_OT19140:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID"

                    page</remotelink></p><h3>OTO&#8217;s aim</h3><p>OTO&#8217;s aim is to obtain a
                    reconciliation of claims and returns to accounts and computations for every
                    producer and for every year in which that producer is involved in the North Sea.
                    For the future it will be the aim to receive the reconciliations together with
                    the CT computations in line with the target dates set by pay and file. Indeed
                    for a company masking PRT expenditure claims a reconciliation should henceforth
                    be regarded as an integral part of the CT computation. It is recommended that
                    there are in many cases a substantial number of back years for which
                    reconciliations still need to be provided. In some cases it may be necessary to
                    adopt a different standard of reconciliation for these earlier years in order to
                    clear the backing. Wherever possible and in particular where it can be seen that
                    little or no tax is at risk, OTO will adopt a pragmatic approach to the need to
                    clear reconciliations for early years.</p><p>The primary course of the
                    reconciliation is to provide a check on PRT not on CT so CT appeals should not
                    be kept open solely because reconciliations are outstanding. However Inspectors
                    have found the analysis in reconciliations helpful in examining CT computations
                    and there have been instances of errors in CT computations being discovered in
                    the course of performing the PRT/Accounts reconciliation.</p><p>Companies that
                    have not submitted reconciliations should be encouraged to supply details of the
                    dates by which they expect to supply reconciliations. If companies are reluctant
                    to supply timetables or if having done so they fall behind schedule careful
                    consideration should be given to what action is appropriate on OTO&#8217;s part
                    taking into account all relevant facts. Depending on the circumstances it may be
                    necessary to defer taking decisions on claims until reconciliations are
                    received.</p><p>It is important that when companies are taken over or when a
                    field interest is sold, the purchaser retains access to all the information
                    needed to produce outstanding reconciliations and to analyse expenditure shown
                    as unclaimed on reconciliations that have been received. If we are involved in
                    any pre-transaction clearances the opportunity should be taken to draw attention
                    to the need to retain access to old record.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04"

                    accounts and CT computations</h3><p>Before considering the reconciliation to the
                    accounts it is convenient to consider the information that ideally should be
                    provided in the CT computations. UK incorporated companies will submit audited
                    accounts and in nearly all cases non UK incorporated companies will also provide
                    audited accounts. In any case where a company declines to submit audited
                    accounts OTO will need to consider with the company whether the accounts
                    submitted are adequate for tax purposes, the company&#8217;s reasons for not
                    submitting audited accounts, and possibly further measures by way of inspection
                    of primary accounting records that may be needed on an ongoing basis. If extra
                    resources are needed to examine claims and computations from companies that do
                    not produce audited accounts this may lead to some delay in the taking of
                    decisions.</p><p>The starting point for the computations should be an analysis
                    of the movement on the fixed asset accounts between the opening and closing
                    balances of the year of both tangible and intangible assets. The movement should
                    be broken down on a field by field basis and also within each field by reference
                    to capital allowance categories. Non field expenditure, in particular
                    exploration, should be analysed by block or by license wherever possible
                    highlighting in particular areas which are close to development. It should also
                    be the aim to analyse operating expenditure on a field by field basis as well as
                    between internal categories and the allocation of any head office costs, parent
                    company costs or research and development into the company and/or into fields
                    should also be shown.</p><p>Receipts such as compensation and insurance receipts
                    should be identified. They may not appear in the profit and loss account but may
                    be treated as adjustments to fixed assets accounts that is as credits to those
                    accounts. These items need to be identified so that the gross expenditure on the
                    fixed asset account can be reconciled with expenditure claims. When such items
                    are identified in the computations by Inspectors dealing with CT they should
                    report them to the Inspector dealing with the particular field or other affected
                    area of claim for consideration. Miscellaneous receipts should be reported in a
                    similar fashion (e.g. receipts arising out of exploration or
                        research).</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04"

                    reconciliation</h3><p>The reconciliation should take account of incomings to
                    identify all receipts and reconcile them to the PRT1. In particular S493
                    adjustments should be recorded between the CT accounts and the PRT returns and
                    tariff receipts and chargeable disposal receipts also need to be
                    identified.</p><p>The format of the reconciliation is a matter for the
                    particular company but it should provide all the information set out below.
                    Companies should be encouraged to supply only a reconciliation of the accounts
                    to claims and refrain from providing the intermediate stages that the company
                    needs to go through such as reconciliations to trial balances and billings.
                    Operators will however be expected to provide reconciliations between Schedule 5
                    claims and billings to all other participators in fields for which they are
                    operator. OTO will consider operators performance in this area in any review of
                    the suitability of a particular operator to act as responsible person.</p><p>A
                    reconciliation which amalgamates several years may be acceptable in clearing
                    arrears where little or no tax is at stake. This may be in situations where it
                    is accepted that there is little likelihood of there being any tax payable in
                    respect of the field, in situations where expiry of time limits is not likely to
                    be a factor because the periods terminate before the first claim period for any
                    affected field ends, and in circumstances where the expenditure is clearly seen
                    to be in a period where the field is pre-pay back. It will still be necessary to
                    have a more detailed year by year analysis and consideration of accruals around
                    the period at which a field approaches pay back. Because Sch 7 claims are always
                    intended to be tax effective it will be necessary to reconcile them on an annual
                    basis.</p><p>The reconciliation should be designed to tie the expenditure in the
                    accounts which has already been analysed on a field by field basis back to
                    identified expenditure claims under Schedule 5 and Schedule 6. There should also
                    be a full reconciliation of exploration expenditure and any research and
                    development as analysed in the accounts and computations back to the Schedule 7
                    claims. The analysis of claims should identify the claim numbers agreed with the
                    OTO and if that information is not available the date of the claim.</p><p>The
                    reconciliation should identify unclaimable expenditure in particular terms such
                    as interest, depreciation, onshore exploration and buildings. Expenditure on
                    exempt gas fields also needs to be separately identified. This is necessary so
                    that it can be seen that none of this expenditure has unwittingly franked claims
                    that have been made. Inspectors should look for negative amounts in this
                    expenditure analysis as these may indicate receipts which have been ignored for
                    PRT purposes.</p><p>If the reconciliation reveals over claims they should be
                    explicitly identified when the reconciliation is presented to OTO. (See also
                    Examination of the Reconciliations below).</p><p>There will be a residue of
                    expenditure which is in principle claimable for PRT purposes but has not yet
                    been claimed. This will relate to fields under development, and similar
                    prospects and also unutilised exploration expenditure where the taxpayer has no
                    need of Schedule 7 claims. It is important that this expenditure is analysed to
                    the extent that is possible when the reconciliation is prepared. This will
                    enable future claims to be checked against this analysis and avoid a further
                    reconciliation. It will be useful if an ongoing memorandum of unclaimed amounts
                    is submitted each year with the reconciliation for the latest year showing the
                    unclaimed amounts of earlier years updated by claims made since the previous
                    reconciliation.</p><p>OTO does not recognise as a general principle that there
                    may be a setting off of over claims against &#8220;under claims&#8221;.
                    Companies are not obliged to claim expenditure and OTO cannot be involved in
                    considering whether an &#8220;under claim&#8221; arose as a result of deliberate
                    policy or as a result of error. In considering culpability in relation to over
                    claims OTO will not as a matter of principle accept the offsetting of over
                    claims with &#8220;under claims&#8221; but a flexible approach will be taken in
                    setting particular cases and regard will always be had to all of the
                    circumstances and the merits of the particular case before forming a view on
                    culpability.</p><p>Where the company is not the operator for a field it will
                    probably have unrecognisable differences because of differences in exchange rate
                    policies and accruals. The resolution of such problems will be dealt with on a
                    case by case basis. Inspectors will need to consider carefully explanations put
                    forward and exercise judgement in reaching agreement with companies. Similarly
                    the reconciliation may include amounts described as unclaimed amounts. These may
                    constitute over claims. And accounts expenditure may need to be increased in the
                    course of the reconciliation by various adjustments to make the figures
                    reconcile. Inspectors will need to consider such adjustments critically. It
                    would help the process of reconciliation and the examination of claims if
                    companies would, when making claims, always specifically identify and give the
                    reasons for negative items of expenditure included within claims.</p><p>It will
                    be necessary to analyse the turnover in the accounts between arm&#8217;s length
                    and non arm&#8217;s length sales in order to agree adjustments under S493. If
                    this analysis is provided before final agreement of valuation issues has taken
                    place it is possible that they may be changes in the designation of sales from
                    arm&#8217;s length to non arm&#8217;s length. It may be necessary therefore to
                    check that the analysis is agreed. Errors in this area are likely to operate
                    against the taxpayer&#8217;s interest.</p><p>In certain circumstances, the OTO
                    will agree to examine &#8216;informal&#8217; claims, particularly those relating
                    to Schedule 7 expenditure. This procedure enables a company to submit details of
                    allowable expenditure without, in the case of Schedule 7 claims, specifying the
                    field of claim or period for allowance until a formal claim is submitted. The
                    procedure operates on the basis that the same care is required for an informal
                    as for a formal claim, and that the latter must specify the exact items being
                    claimed from any formal &#8216;pool&#8217;. The reconciliation should be to the
                    informal claim, which will normally be based on accounting periods. Where
                    subsequent formal claims have been made they will already be reconciled to the
                    informal claim.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04"

                    reconciliations have been received in OTO should be taken into account by each
                    Inspector with PRT responsibilities for the taxpayer and for each field in which
                    the company is a participator in examining claims.</p><p>It is expected that the
                    first reconciliations that are received from any company will need the most
                    careful examination. Inspectors will need to satisfy themselves that the
                    reconciliation has been competently performed and that all matters that need to
                    be considered have been considered. It will be necessary for the Inspector to
                    inform himself as to the detailed way in which the reconciliation has been
                    completed and presented. Provided the method of doing the reconciliation remains
                    consistent it is to be anticipated that future reconciliations will be agreed
                    more readily. The greatest value in reconciliations will therefore have been
                    achieved by the time the reconciliation is completed. By that time companies
                    will probably have made any further claims that they feel they ought to have
                    made and they will have notified OTO individually of over claims as they have
                    been identified.</p><p>Paragraph 9 Schedule 2 OTA 1975 provides that where any
                    return statement, declaration or accounts as are mentioned in Paragraph 8
                    Schedule 2 were made or submitted by any person neither fraudulently nor
                    negligently and it comes to his notice those were incorrect then, unless the
                    error is remedied without unreasonable delay, the return statement, declaration
                    or account shall be treated as having been negligently made or submitted by the
                    first mentioned person. It is important therefore that as companies discover
                    errors or over claims in the course of performing the reconciliations they bring
                    them to OTO&#8217;s attention immediately without waiting for completion of the
                    reconciliation. This will ensure that in cases where the original error was not
                    one arising from negligence that Para 9 does not operate to treat it as
                    such.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_OT19140:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA"
                        remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of
                        page</remotelink></p><h3>Results</h3><p>It is accepted that a totally
                    balanced reconciliation will often prove difficult to achieve. Whatever method a
                    company uses most exercises will finish with an unexplained difference. As far
                    as seems reasonable, having regard to the amount of the difference both in
                    absolute terms and in relation to total expenditure, the company should
                    endeavour to establish the reason or likely reason for the difference. In the
                    final analysis it is a matter for judgement at what point and level an
                    unexplained difference should be accepted. Clearly a difference representing
                    excess PRT claimed expenditure over CT expenditure gives OTO more cause for
                    concern than the reverse situation. It is in fact more likely on the evidence of
                    completed reconciliations seen that the company will uncover PRT claimable but
                    unclaimed expenditure as a result of the exercise. Additional expenditure claims
                    submitted in these circumstances will be subjected to careful examination. Where
                    for time limit reasons such an additional claim is submitted before submission
                    and examination of the reconciliation concerned, examination of the PRT claim
                    may need to be deferred until the reconciliation is submitted and
                    examined.</p><p>When further claims are made as a result of a reconciliation it
                    is not enough for a company to identify the existence of unclaimed amounts.
                    There may have been good reason for not claiming the expenditure. Thus claims
                    arising from a reconciliation must identify the nature of the expenditure and
                    demonstrate that it is allowable in the particular field or under Schedule
                    7.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04"
