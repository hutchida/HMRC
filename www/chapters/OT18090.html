Instead, any provisional relief in either of the two previous chargeable periods that has not already been clawed back is recovered in the assessment for the transfer period.</p><sup>3</sup><p>Inspectors should note when assessing that all necessary adjustments should be made manually - the computer system automatically calculates provisional allowance without reference to any transfers. Similarly, adjustments will need to be made afresh each time the relevant assessments are amended.</p><sup>4</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>5</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
