In these situations the &#8220;Tariff from the user field&#8221; is the tariff received or receivable for the use or services provided. Where however the amount of the tariff received or receivable does not fully reflect the value of the use or services provided it will be necessary to consider if the cost allocation should be calculated by reference to the gross tariff that would have been receivable or if the modified approach should only be applied to that part of the expenditure attributable to the use that relates to the net tariff. </p><p>A tariff may include an element intended to recover capital costs incurred by the host field. Where the expenditure incurred is not allowable to the host (for example user field tying-in costs - see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT15920:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT15920</remotelink>) the gross tariff should be reduced by the amount intended to recover these capital costs for the purpose of ascertaining the &#8220;Tariff from the user field&#8221;. </p><h3>Average cost</h3><p>For the purpose of the modified cost allocation approach &#8220;Average cost&#8221; is:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>for operating expenditure - the user field&#8217;s share of non-field specific expenditure incurred in connection with the asset allocated by reference to the throughput of the fields using the asset during the claim period, </p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>for long term asset expenditure - the user field&#8217;s share of the long term asset expenditure allocated by reference to the fields expected to use the asset on the basis of their expected recoverable reserves. </p></li><h3>Incremental cost</h3><p>For the purpose of the modified cost allocation approach &#8220;Incremental cost&#8221; is:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>for operating expenditure - the additional non-field specific expenditure incurred in connection with the asset as a consequence of use in relation to the user field during the claim period, </p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>for long term asset expenditure - the additional long term asset expenditure incurred as a consequence of use or expected use in relation to the user field. </p></li><h3>Practical Application</h3><p>The responsible person (<remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT04030:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT04030</remotelink>) may wish to discuss the practical application of the modified approach with LB Oil &amp; Gas in advance of claims being made. The modified approach requires a comparison of 50% of the tariff, incremental cost and average cost over the period of use by the user field. It is envisaged that in most situations it will be clear from the outset if an amount equivalent to 50% of the tariff will exceed incremental cost. Where an amount equivalent to 50% of the tariff does not exceed incremental cost LB Oil &amp; Gas will be willing to take a view as to the likely proportion of incremental costs and to agree an appropriate cost allocation on a forward basis. </p><p>It is also envisaged that it should be possible to determine if an amount equivalent to 50% of the tariff is likely to exceed average cost or fall below average cost. In order to reduce the need for period by period comparisons LB Oil &amp; Gas will therefore be prepared to agree with the responsible person whether the cost allocation to be used for future periods should be an amount equivalent to 50% of the tariff or average cost as appropriate. </p><p>Where a responsible person wishes to agree a forward basis LB Oil &amp; Gas will need to consider the tariffing arrangement and underlying cost projections relating to the new business. Where it is not possible to determine at the outset what the appropriate cost allocation basis should be, or the responsible person does not opt to agree a forward basis, it will be necessary for comparisons to be made on a cumulative basis each claim period. LB Oil &amp; Gas will need to review the basis used to calculate the amount equivalent to 50% of the tariff, incremental cost and average cost at the outset and at periodic intervals.</p><p>Where the modified approach applies expenditure claims made by the responsible person and claims by the participators should identify the restrictions made to exclude the costs attributable to tax-exempt tariffing and should include a calculation of the appropriate disallowance. Where possible, LB Oil &amp; Gas will normally expect the full disallowance for tax-exempt tariffing in a chargeable period (<remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT04005:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT04005</remotelink>) to be reflected in the Schedule 5 claim for the claim period (<remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT04420:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT04420</remotelink>).
