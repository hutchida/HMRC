Tribunals have given a lot of weight to the intention of traders. Where it is evident that</p><sup>1</sup><p>the traders’ intention was to operate as separate entities, and</p><sup>2</sup><p>they have made a genuine attempt to separate the business activities</p><sup>3</sup><p>the Tribunal will invariably decide in their favour; see R Wallace at page VATDSAG08400.</p><sup>4</sup><p>If the explanation you are given would be a difficult one to dispute, especially before a Tribunal, you should accept that more than one legal entity exists. In such circumstances, you should still consider whether the separation is artificial and thus whether a Notice of Direction should be issued (see VATDSAG06000).</p><sup>5</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>6</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
