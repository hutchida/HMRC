To compensate for this, one way of giving the producer security for the development is for the sale contract to oblige the buyer to pay for a certain quantity of gas each ‘period’ whether or not that amount is actually taken.

The former arrangement would give rise to a normal PRT gross profit contribution equal to the advance payment, when the gas is subsequently delivered.

If make-up gas from one period at one price is being delivered, the corresponding payment is a simple proportion of the total. Where, however, make-up gas is derived from more than one previous period, the calculation of the PRT gross profit contribution requires attribution of payments received in a number of previous periods to gas delivered in each subsequent period. In order to arrive at an appropriate proportion, the averaging method has generally been used, which takes the total value and total volume of ‘free’ gas and then applies the average price derived from this to all quantities delivered subsequently.
