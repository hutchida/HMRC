To compensate for this, one way of giving the producer security for the development is for the sale contract to oblige the buyer to pay for a certain quantity of gas each &#8216;period&#8217; whether or not that amount is actually taken. The arrangements will usually give the buyer the opportunity to make up the quantity paid for but not taken. The make-up may be taken either</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>in priority over that period&#8217;s contract amount; or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>only when the minimum for that period has been taken.</p></li><p>There may also be a limit on the time in which make-up gas can be recovered.</p><p>Where a payment in a period exceeds the charge for the amount of gas actually taken, the arrangements may treat the excess as an advance payment for the make-up gas to be taken in the future, or they may simply give the buyer a right to take volumes free of charge in the future. The former arrangement would give rise to a normal PRT gross profit contribution equal to the advance payment, when the gas is subsequently delivered. In the latter arrangement the payment is treated as if it was an advance payment, and the subsequent recovery of &#8216;free&#8217; gas leads again to a PRT gross profit contribution when the gas is delivered.</p><p>Where the arrangement is for the recovery of &#8216;free&#8217; gas, a corresponding part of the original payment is attributed to the amount of gas when delivered - FA84\\S114(2) and FA84\\S114(3). If make-up gas from one period at one price is being delivered, the corresponding payment is a simple proportion of the total. Where, however, make-up gas is derived from more than one previous period, the calculation of the PRT gross profit contribution requires attribution of payments received in a number of previous periods to gas delivered in each subsequent period. In order to arrive at an appropriate proportion, the averaging method has generally been used, which takes the total value and total volume of &#8216;free&#8217; gas and then applies the average price derived from this to all quantities delivered subsequently.
