EOY data about each of these schemes that was active in that tax year will be sent over to BROCS (for tax years up to 2012-13 only) where it will then be matched to a scheme reference. Automated checks will be made to determine whether all expected returns for that tax year have been received and processed with no exceptions that are likely to affect the EOY total deductions figure. The information sent to BROCS will consist of the total cumulated deductions for the year as shown on the monthly returns, and that figure will be given a status.</p><p>After an EOY figure has been sent to BROCS it may become clear that this figure is no longer correct. The information previously sent to BROCS will be examined and when an amendment results in a change to the EOY figures a figure representing the difference between the last EOY figure calculated and the revised figure will be sent to BROCS, see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CISR69020:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CISR69020</remotelink> for details of the End of Year Process.</p><h3>End of Year Totals window</h3><p>The top panel lists the Accounts Office reference, there is also an entry &#8216;Tax Year Ended&#8217; which will be populated with the requested tax year (showing tax years up to 2012-13 only) when a selection is made by the user to view more information for a tax year shown in the list box below.</p><p>The lower panel consists of a list box displaying the following information for each tax year that the scheme has been active and an EOY figure has been calculated.</p><p>Note: If the selected record you are viewing has been merged, transferred or succeeded during the tax year the information in the window below will be arranged slightly differently to that shown below. You should therefore familiarise yourself with the information shown below at &#8216;Scheme Movements&#8217; before continuing.</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Tax Year End -</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Payments - The total payments made by the scheme based on the effective returns received for the tax year.</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Materials - The total material costs paid to subcontractors by the scheme based on the effective returns for the tax year.</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Deductions - The total deductions made from subcontractors by the scheme based on the effective returns for the tax year.</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><nl />EOY Status - The current status of the EOY figure, this will be either<li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Inactive - if the scheme has been inactive throughout the whole of the tax year.</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Full - where a return has been received for each month that the scheme was live and a return was expected, or any periods where no returns have been received but they have been marked as exempt.

For example, if a contractor submits six monthly returns followed by a six month period of inactivity in that tax year, the status of the EOY total deducted figure for the six returns would be &#8216;Full&#8217; as no returns are expected for the period of inactivity. Also, if a contractor ceased on 15 January and had submitted ten monthly returns covering April to cessation in the year, this too would be shown as &#8216;Full&#8217;.</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Provisional - Where it is identified that not all expected returns for the scheme and tax year have been received or processed, or one or more of the expected returns for the scheme and tax year have outstanding exceptions linked to them that may affect the cumulated total deductions figure - such as unreadable or minus entries within amount fields on returns submitted.
