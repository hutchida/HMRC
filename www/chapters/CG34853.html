If the losses exceed the gains the net losses are carried forward and are available for set-off against future trust gains. See CG15812 about quantifying losses before Self Assessment. For 1996-97 onwards, losses have to be claimed and certain losses take precedence, see CG15813.</p><sup>2</sup><p>Any excess of allowable losses arising to the trustees cannot be set off against the personal gains of the settlor.</p><sup>3</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>4</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
