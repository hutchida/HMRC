The measurement of these liabilities (and, in certain cases, whether they are recognised at all) will depend on the accounting policies under which the group accounts are prepared.</p><sup>3</sup><p>For example, a group that prepares consolidated accounts under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) may have designated a particular liability as the hedged item in a fair value hedge of interest rate risk and, in accordance with IAS 39.89, or IFRS9.6.5.8, adjust the carrying amount of liability for gains or losses attributable to movements in interest rates. A group with a similar liability, hedged in a similar way, which prepared its consolidated accounts under different accounting policies might measure the liability at amortised cost.</p><sup>4</sup><p>In the same way, where the full rules need to be applied, computation of the available amount (CFM92400+) depends on amounts disclosed in the group’s financial statements and will therefore depend on the accounting policies adopted. Exact comparability between groups could be obtained by insisting that - specifically for UK tax purposes - amounts were computed using the same accounting standards applied in the same way. This would impose a very significant compliance burden.</p><sup>5</sup><p>As a compromise, TIOPA10/S347 requires the financial statements of the worldwide group to be ‘acceptable’.
