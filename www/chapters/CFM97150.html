This ten year limit is not limited by reference to the current owner.</p><sup>3</sup><h4>Example 1</h4><sup>4</sup><p>Company A constructs temporary accommodation for military barracks. It is expected at construction these will be unsuitable for use in 5-7 years. This accommodation has an expected economic life (EEL) of less than 10 years and would not be considered Infrastructure of the UK.</p><sup>5</sup><h4>Example 2</h4><sup>6</sup><p>Company B constructs an assault course at a different military barracks. This is considered to have useful life of 25 years. It has an EEL of greater than 10 years in Company B’s hands.</p><sup>7</sup><p>Company C acquires the assault course 20 years into its use. Even if this asset will cease to be of use in 5 years, it will still be considered an asset which had an EEL of greater than 10 years in Company C’s hands.</p><sup>8</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>9</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
