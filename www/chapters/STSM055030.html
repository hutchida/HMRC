This is a letter sent to the prospective subscribers, i.e. the existing holders of shares in the company in respect of which the offer is made, saying that a number of new shares have been allotted to them in proportion to their existing holding, free of payment (commonly called a bonus or scrip issue), or inviting the shareholder to subscribe by paying for some or all of the new shares provisionally allotted to them in proportion to their existing holding.

If a shareholder decides not to take up the offer by the closing date, the allotment letter will lapse. </p><h3>Renounceable Letter of Allotment (RLA)</h3><p>A public company will usually issue renounceable letters of allotment to its existing shareholders allowing them to subscribe for further shares. While the RLA remains provisional until such time the shareholder has accepted the offer and paid for the new shares, the letter has some value, as it provides the shareholder with the right to acquire new shares at below the current market price, or alternatively renounce i.e. sell, the rights to subscribe for the shares to a third party.</p><p>Similarly, if a shareholder decides not to take up the offer at the end of the renunciation period, the allotment letter will lapse.</p><p>See <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM055040:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">STSM055040</remotelink>-STSM055100 for stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax implications when a PAL or RLA is deposited with a depositary receipt issuer or clearance service.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM055020:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM055040:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><h3>Allotment Letter</h3><p>If a public company announces a bonus issue or a rights issue of new shares, the company will usually issue a letter of allotment.
