OTA75\S8 is sufficient in that it will entitle both OP and the new participator (NP) to a share of the oil allowance for the transfer period based on their respective shares of the oil won and saved during that period. If the normal arrangement is that oil allowance is allocated on a ‘liftings’ basis, then OP and NP will take shares calculated by reference to their respective liftings. If the oil allowance is shared on an ‘equity’ basis, then the joint share attributable to the field interest passing from OP to NP should be time apportioned.</p><sup>6</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>7</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
