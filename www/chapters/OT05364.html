It is also specified in the legislation that if, in any chargeable period, the extent to which gases are disposed of is such that the seller would, in an arm’s length contract, incur financial penalties for failing to meet the pattern of supply specified in the election and those penalties would not be insubstantial, then this is a ground for the Board to terminate the election. The parties to the election may appeal against a notice given by the Board.</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\OT05364.xml</p><hr/><sup>0</sup><p>An election normally continues in force until the period specified expires.
