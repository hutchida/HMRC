The effect of designating a fair value hedge is that the carrying value of the loan relationship is adjusted for fair value changes relating to the risk being hedged (CFM27140). So, where interest rate risk is being hedged, fair value profits and losses relating to interest rate changes will go through profit and loss account, and will be taken into account for CT purposes. Here again, there is no need for regulation 9 to have effect since the company has an effective hedge both pre-tax and post-tax.</p><sup>12</sup><p>The Regulation can have effect where</p><sup>13</sup><p>The interest rate contract has been designated as a cash flow hedge of a loan relationship asset or liability that is accounted for at amortised cost.
