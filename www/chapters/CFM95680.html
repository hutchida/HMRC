Where a credit is given under TIOPA10/S18, an adjustment should also be made to the amount included in tax-interest to take account of the foreign tax charge.</p><sup>2</sup><p>This adjustment is calculated by dividing the TIOPA10/S18 credit amount by the rate of corporation tax payable by the UK company. This gives the notional untaxed income amount which is then excluded from tax-interest.</p><sup>3</sup><h4>Example</h4><sup>4</sup><p>A Ltd earns interest of £10m in Country X with tax of £1.2m levied on this by the Xanadu Revenue Agency in the year ended 31 March 2018. A Ltd pays UK corporation tax at 19% but a credit for the foreign tax of £1.2m is given by virtue of TIOPA10/S18.</p><sup>5</sup><p>The notional untaxed income amount will be £6.3m arrived at by dividing the TIOPA10/S18 credit (£1.2m) by the rate of corporation tax payable (19%). The total interest income figure is then reduced by this amount resulting in a £3.7m credit being taken to tax-interest.</p><sup>6</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>7</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
