Where the participator makes a part disposal of an asset only the use attributable to that part is taken into account. Similarly if the participator who made the disposal acquired an interest in an asset from another participator in a taxable field only the use by the previous owner relating to that interest is taken into account. For the purpose of determining the use of an asset that is referable to the interest disposed of, or a previous owner&#8217;s represented interest, a just and reasonable view is taken based on the history of the interests in asset.</p><h3>Earlier Disposals OTA83\\S7A(6)</h3><p>Any use by a previous owner within the 6 year period that would otherwise be taken into account in the calculation of the reduction is excluded where that use was taken into account in an earlier calculation. </p><h3>Brought-In Assets OTA83\\S7A(7)</h3><p>The rules are modified where the asset is a &#8216;brought-in asset&#8217; (<remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT11500:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT11500</remotelink>) and the receipts on the disposal of the asset are subject to a reduction under OTA83\\Sch2\\Para9 (<remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT15060:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT15060</remotelink>).
