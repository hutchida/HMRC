The adjudication stamp thus gives absolute certainty to any party required to act upon the document that the correct SD has been paid.

It is only a provisional opinion, because everybody knows that it does not carry finality. If a person wants to be perfectly certain of the amount, and to be perfectly certain that that amount will never be questioned thereafter by the Inland Revenue, there is a well-known and statutory way of doing it, namely, by asking for an adjudication stamp, and, of course, if he gets an adjudication stamp, then the mouth of the Inland Revenue is shut forever upon the question of the amount of the stamp. But side by side with that which is the method when it is wanted to make the thing absolutely certain, there is the very convenient method which I have described.”</p><sup>2</sup><p>The vast majority of transactions where adjudication is not required by statute proceed along the method described.</p><sup>3</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>4</sup><p> Next page</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\STSM022030.xml</p><hr/><sup>title</sup><h3>Stamp Duty: Finality Of Adjudication</h3><sup>0</sup><p>Adjudication, when completed, is final and thereafter the correctness of the Stamp Duty paid on any particular document may not be challenged by HMRC.
