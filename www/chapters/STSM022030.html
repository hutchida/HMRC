If a person wants to be perfectly certain of the amount, and to be perfectly certain that that amount will never be questioned thereafter by the Inland Revenue, there is a well-known and statutory way of doing it, namely, by asking for an adjudication stamp, and, of course, if he gets an adjudication stamp, then the mouth of the Inland Revenue is shut forever upon the question of the amount of the stamp.
