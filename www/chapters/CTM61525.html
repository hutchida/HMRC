In particular, for example:</p><sup>6</sup><p>where the trust holds shares in a close company, any loan by that company to the trust will be chargeable because the trustee or trustees are all participators or associates of a participator (and each trustee will be a relevant person, either because that trustee is an individual or, in the case of a corporate trustee, because CTA10/S455 (6) makes them a relevant person)</p><sup>7</sup><p>where the trust holds shares, any loan made in a personal capacity to one of the trustees, or an associate of the trustee, will be chargeable because as trustee he is a participator</p><sup>8</sup><p>where the trust does not hold shares in the company but the trustees are associates of a participator in the company through the operation of CTA10/S448, for example where a participator in the company is also the settlor of the trust, loans to the trustee(s) and/or trust will be chargeable</p><sup>9</sup><p>where the trust does not hold shares in the company but each of the trustees is a relevant person who, as well as being a trustee of the trust is also a participator or associate of a participator, loans to the trustee(s) and/or the trust will be chargeable</p><sup>10</sup><p>if none of these is the case, CTA10/S459 may apply when the trustees make payments (including loans) to any participators or associates</p><sup>11</sup><p>The capacity in which a person receives a loan is not material; Section 455 does not specify the capacity in which any loan is made. Thus in the second example above if an individual is a trustee of a trust which holds shares in the company making the loan, but receives a loan in his personal capacity rather than in his capacity as trustee, the loan will be chargeable under Section 455. He is a participator (as trustee), he is an individual, and he has received a loan. That is all that the section requires.</p><sup>12</sup><p>Where a company has an employee share scheme and makes loans to certain employees to buy shares from existing shareholders, CTA10/S455 (1) will apply where the specific employee is already a shareholder, or CTA10/S459 may apply following the acquisition of the shares. However, CTA10/S456 (3) to (8) may exempt such loans where the relevant conditions are met (see CTM61540).</p><sup>13</sup><p>In any case of doubt or difficulty, particularly where a charity is involved, please refer with the papers to CTIS (Technical).</p><sup>14</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>15</sup><p> Next page</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\CTM61525.xml</p><hr/><sup>title</sup><h3>Loans To Trusts</h3><sup>0</sup><p>For all periods (ie pre and post the FA13 changes) loans to trustees/trusts are chargeable under CTA10/S455 in relevant circumstances.
