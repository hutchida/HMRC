Similarly, receipts that would otherwise fall within TIOPA10/PT7/S314 are not financing income amounts. This means that the company cannot have a net financing deduction, and no disallowance can be allocated to it under chapter 3. Nor can it have net financing income, and interest or similar income that it receives cannot be disregarded under chapter 4, or under the provisions relating to certain financing income from European Economic Area companies in chapter 5 (see CFM92800 onwards).</p><p>A group treasury company must make an election within three years after the end of the period of account concerned.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CFM92530:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CFM92530</remotelink> - <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CFM92540:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CFM92540</remotelink> explains what is meant by a &#8216;group treasury company&#8217;.</p><h3>Periods of account ending before 17 July 2012</h3><p>The original provisions apply to periods of account of a worldwide group from the time TIOPA10/PT7 first came into effect, that is, periods that begin on or after 1 January 2010, and which end before 17 July 2012.&#160;Under the original provisions a company had to be a group treasury company as defined to make an election.</p><p>Further the election was not valid unless all group treasury companies in the worldwide also so elected.
