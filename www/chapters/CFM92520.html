Similarly, receipts that would otherwise fall within TIOPA10/PT7/S314 are not financing income amounts. This means that the company cannot have a net financing deduction, and no disallowance can be allocated to it under chapter 3. Nor can it have net financing income, and interest or similar income that it receives cannot be disregarded under chapter 4, or under the provisions relating to certain financing income from European Economic Area companies in chapter 5 (see CFM92800 onwards).</p><sup>9</sup><p>A group treasury company must make an election within three years after the end of the period of account concerned.</p><sup>10</sup><h3>Periods of account ending before 17 July 2012</h3><sup>11</sup><p>The original provisions apply to periods of account of a worldwide group from the time TIOPA10/PT7 first came into effect, that is, periods that begin on or after 1 January 2010, and which end before 17 July 2012. Under the original provisions a company had to be a group treasury company as defined to make an election.</p><sup>12</sup><p>Further the election was not valid unless all group treasury companies in the worldwide also so elected.

The effect of this amendment was that there is no longer an effective requirement that all group treasury companies made the election; an election made by one company could be valid even where other eligible companies did not elect.</p><sup>15</sup><h3>Periods of account beginning on or after 11 December 2012</h3><sup>16</sup><p>Further amendments were made by FA13 with effect for periods of account beginning on or after 11 December 2012. The main effect of these amendments is that a company is only a group treasury company if it makes an election and even if it does, it is possible that only a part of its financing expense amounts and financing income amounts will be left out of account. There is no requirement that all eligible companies make an election.</p><sup>17</sup><p>There were two changes to the conditions made for these periods.</p><sup>18</sup><p>First, to be a group treasury company, a company must have made an election for the relevant period.

If, having made an election, all or substantially all of a company’s activities are treasury activities and all or substantially all of its assets and liabilities relate to such activities, the company’s financing expenses and financing income are included in the election. But, if that is not the case, the only financing expenses and financing income included in the election are those that relate to its treasury activities.
