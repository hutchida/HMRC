Where an appeal is made, the tribunal is required to determine whether or not HMRC were entitled to take the view that the notification wasn&#8217;t received by the relevant deadline.</p><p>An example of this could be where an individual sent a notification for FP 2012&#160;but HMRC received it after 6 April 2012. If HMRC have taken the view not to accept the late notification as they consider it out of time, the individual can appeal about whether HMRC was correct to consider that the notification was received after the deadline and therefore it did not meet the conditions set out in the legislation.</p><p>For IP 2014&#160;there is no provision in the IP 2014 notification regulations for&#160;any appeal right to the Tribunal against a refusal by HMRC to accept a late IP 2014&#160;notification as the deadline for notification is contained in primary legislation in Schedule 6 of Finance Act 2014.&#160;Paragraph 1(1) Schedule 6 provides that intention to reply on&#160;IP 2014 must be given to an officer of Revenue and Customs before 6 April 2017.&#160;So if an application is not received by that date there is no Paragraph 1 notice for the purposes of the IP 2014 notification regulations.&#160;And the primary legislation makes no provision for an individual to appeal against a decision by HMRC not to issue an IP 2014 certificate because they were not notified by the deadline.</p><p>Further guidance on how to make an appeal can be found at https://www.gov.uk/tax-appeals.</p><h3>Discretionary powers</h3><p>FP 2012 - Regulation 6 The Registered Pension Schemes (Lifetime Allowance Transitional Protection) Regulations 2011 - SI 2011/1752</p><p>FP 2014 - Regulation 6 The Registered Pension Schemes and Relieved Non-UK Pensions Schemes (Lifetime Allowance Transitional Protection) (Notification) Regulations 2013 - SI 2013/1741</p><p>IP 2014 - Section 5(1) The Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005</p><p>There are no reasonable excuse provisions within the legislation for FP 2012, FP 2014 and IP 2014 which would allow HMRC to accept a late notification.

These are set out in:</p><p>FP 2012 - Regulations 4 to7 The Registered Pension Schemes (Lifetime Allowance Transitional Protection) Regulations 2011 -SI 2011/1752</p><p>FP 2014 - Regulations 4 to 7 The Registered Pension Schemes and Relieved Non-UK pensions schemes (Lifetime Allowance Transitional Protections)(Notification) Regulations 2013 - SI 2013/1741</p><p>IP 2014 - Regulations 4 to 7 The Registered Pension Schemes and Relieved Non-UK Pension Schemes (Lifetime Allowance Transitional Protection)(Individual Protection 2014 Notification) Regulations 2014 - SI2014/1842</p><p>The regulations for FP 2012, FP 2014 and IP 2014 set out the requirements&#160;that need to be met to enable HMRC to accept a notification for FP 2012, FP 2014 or IP 2014.&#160;For FP 2012&#160;and FP 2014&#160;one of the requirements&#160;is that&#160;the notification&#160;must be received by HMRC on or before the deadlines set out in the relevant regulations.&#160;An individual can appeal against a refusal by HMRC to accept the notification for&#160;FP 2012&#160;and FP 2014&#160;on the grounds that HMRC was not entitled to take the view that the notice did not meet the requirements as it was received after the deadline. Where an appeal is made, the tribunal is required to determine whether or not HMRC were entitled to take the view that the notification wasn&#8217;t received by the relevant deadline.</p><p>An example of this could be where an individual sent a notification for FP 2012&#160;but HMRC received it after 6 April 2012. If HMRC have taken the view not to accept the late notification as they consider it out of time, the individual can appeal about whether HMRC was correct to consider that the notification was received after the deadline and therefore it did not meet the conditions set out in the legislation.</p><p>For IP 2014&#160;there is no provision in the IP 2014 notification regulations for&#160;any appeal right to the Tribunal against a refusal by HMRC to accept a late IP 2014&#160;notification as the deadline for notification is contained in primary legislation in Schedule 6 of Finance Act 2014.&#160;Paragraph 1(1) Schedule 6 provides that intention to reply on&#160;IP 2014 must be given to an officer of Revenue and Customs before 6 April 2017.&#160;So if an application is not received by that date there is no Paragraph 1 notice for the purposes of the IP 2014 notification regulations.&#160;And the primary legislation makes no provision for an individual to appeal against a decision by HMRC not to issue an IP 2014 certificate because they were not notified by the deadline.</p><p>Further guidance on how to make an appeal can be found at https://www.gov.uk/tax-appeals.</p><h3>Discretionary powers</h3><p>FP 2012 - Regulation 6 The Registered Pension Schemes (Lifetime Allowance Transitional Protection) Regulations 2011 - SI 2011/1752</p><p>FP 2014 - Regulation 6 The Registered Pension Schemes and Relieved Non-UK Pensions Schemes (Lifetime Allowance Transitional Protection) (Notification) Regulations 2013 - SI 2013/1741</p><p>IP 2014 - Section 5(1) The Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005</p><p>There are no reasonable excuse provisions within the legislation for FP 2012, FP 2014 and IP 2014 which would allow HMRC to accept a late notification. HMRC can, however, in exceptional circumstances, accept a late notification by exercising its discretion under the above regulations in relation to FP 2012 and FP 2014 and under collection and management provisions set out in Section 5(1) of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 in relation to IP 2014 (there being no discretionary power to accept late notifications in the IP 2014 notification regulations).</p><p>Before giving a late notification the person must ensure they still meet the criteria for protection and consideration should be given to whether any actions have been taken that mean that the form of protection will have been lost. In the case of IP 2014, the protection can only be lost (or reduced) if a person&#8217;s pension rights are reduced below the individual&#8217;s personal lifetime allowance as a result of a pension debit applied following a pension sharing order on divorce.&#160;FP 2012&#160;and FP 2014 can be lost in a number of circumstances.</p><p>For example:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>setting up a new arrangement, other than those permitted, or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>having benefit accrual (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM093500:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM093500</remotelink>).</p></li><p>Further details on events which trigger loss of protection can be found in chapter 9 of the PTM for each of the protections.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM095000:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li></div></div></body></html>
