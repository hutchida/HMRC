If Company A incurred 100 decommissioning costs and under the new rules it only received tax relief of 30 (60% of 100 at PRT rate of 50%). The company then makes a claim under the DRD for 20 this is the 50 it would have received as at FA 2013 less the amount it actually received. S83(3)(a) deems the full 100 decommissioning costs to have been relieved against company A&#8217;s PRT profits rather than 60 and S83(3)(b) effectively deems the 20 claimed under the DRD as an additional repayment of PRT.</p><h3>Example 2</h3><p>Company C incurs 100 decommissioning costs as a result of a default by company D.
