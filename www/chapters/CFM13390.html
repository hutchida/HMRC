Suppose the company has bought an item of machinery from a German manufacturer for &#8364;100,000. At the date when the invoice is received, &#8364;100,000 is worth &#163;64,500. The invoice is payable in 30 days, and is paid on time. But in the interim, sterling weakens against the euro, and at the date of payment, &#8364;100,000 is worth &#163;64,800.
