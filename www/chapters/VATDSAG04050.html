For the purposes of the Partnership Act 1890, persons acting in partnership are collectively called ‘a firm’. The terms ‘partnership’ and ‘firm’ are, to all intents and purposes, interchangeable.</p><sup>1</sup><p>A partnership is an unincorporated association in which the agreement between the parties is such that the relationship between</p><sup>2</sup><p>themselves, and</p><sup>3</sup><p>themselves and third parties</p><sup>4</sup><p>is governed by the Partnership Act.</p><sup>5</sup><p>Individual partners may be corporate bodies but the partnership itself will not be incorporated.</p><sup>6</sup><p>The existence of a partnership is a matter of fact. Generally speaking, the essential elements of a partnership are:</p><sup>7</sup><p>there must be a business</p><sup>8</sup><p>the business must be carried on by two or more parties in common with a ‘view to a profit’</p><sup>9</sup><p>those parties share any net profits and losses arising from the business activities</p><sup>10</sup><p>those parties individually have the power, by their words or actions, to legally bind the other members of the firm in relation to its transactions with third parties.</p><sup>11</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
