CTA10/S143(2) (CTM80540) limits the surrenderable amount for the overlapping period by reference to L’s share (CTA10/S145 (2) - CTM80555) of CH’s ordinary share capital.

In addition, for the three-month period to 1/ October 2010 S1 was not in a group relationship with the link company L. So it was not in the same group with L for that time and CTA10/S142(2) (CTM80555) applies to prevent that three months from being part of an overlapping period. So the overlapping period is the three months ended 31 December 2010.</p><sup>39</sup><p>The starting point for working out CH’s ‘surrenderable amount for the overlapping period’ is:</p><sup>40</sup><p>As with P above, CTA10/143(2) limits this by reference to L’s share of CH’s ordinary share capital (CTA10/S145(2)).

The calculation of the maximum amount is by reference to the amount that L could claim if it had sufficient profits and was UK related (CTM80555). That amount is £21,600 (L’s share of CH’s surrenderable amount). The total £19,000 claimed by L (£7,500), P (£10,000), and S1 (£1,500) is less than this, so no further restriction is needed.</p><sup>59</sup><p>Note that if any of CT1, CT2, or CT3 had profits then CTA10/S148 (CTM80580) would apply to reduce CH’s losses available for surrender. This is because CH is both owned by a consortium and is a member of a group and there is the potential for CT1, CT2, and CT3 to make group claims in respect of its losses. CH’s losses of £72,000 would be reduced by the total amount of the maximum group claims possible after taking into account any actual surrenders by other companies in the group.
