The date and venue should be agreed between the record holder and the visiting officer.

After this 14 day period has expired, insurers may be contacted to find out whether all the monies have been reimbursed to their customers. A visit may also be made so that we can check that the monies have been refunded to customers in the agreed manner. In instances of large refunds, do not accept telephone assurances that the refunds have been made.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT07960:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT07970:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>Once procedures have been agreed, a formal copy of the notes on reimbursement and <link alttext="click here to view document" filename="UNDERTAKING_LETTER.DOC" status="valid" type="wordprocess">undertaking (Word 20kb)</link> should be sent to the insurer for their signature.
