For example the scheme administrator may have reported that the lifetime allowance charge is due for a particular member. The scheme administrator later finds that the member had lifetime allowance protection and so no lifetime allowance charge is actually due.</p><p>Whatever the reason for the error the scheme administrator needs to amend the AFT return for the quarter in which the tax arises as soon as they discover a mistake has been made. If you discover, for whatever reason, an individual was left off an AFT return you need to amend the AFT return for the quarter in which the tax charge actually arose. Do not simply add the individual to the next AFT return that is filed.</p><p>If:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>an amendment is being made to an AFT return that was originally submitted before 6 April 2011 and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>it relates to an individual liable to the lifetime allowance charge already reported on the AFT return</p></li><p>the scheme administrator does not have to provide the member&#8217;s National Insurance number (NINO). If the scheme administrator did not originally give the individual&#8217;s NINO and now wishes to supply it they can do so - but they don&#8217;t have to. To enter the NINO using Pension Schemes Online the scheme administrator will need to delete the individual&#8217;s date of birth before submitting the amendment to the AFT return.</p><h3>Penalties for incorrect information</h3><p>Schedule 24 Finance Act 2007</p><p>The Finance Act 2008, Schedule 40 (Appointed Day, Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Order 2009 - SI 2009/57</p><p>For AFT returns for quarters ending 31 March 2010 onwards a penalty is due on the scheme administrator if the AFT return understates the amount of tax actually due, and</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the inaccuracy was deliberate or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the scheme administrator did not take reasonable care in completing the AFT return, or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the scheme administrator discovers they have made mistake on the AFT return and does not take reasonable steps to tell HMRC about the mistake.</p></li><p>The amount of the penalty depends on the behaviour of the scheme administrator.</p><p>The legislation governing these penalties covers many taxpayers and types of tax.

For example the scheme administrator may have reported that the lifetime allowance charge is due for a particular member. The scheme administrator later finds that the member had lifetime allowance protection and so no lifetime allowance charge is actually due.</p><p>Whatever the reason for the error the scheme administrator needs to amend the AFT return for the quarter in which the tax arises as soon as they discover a mistake has been made. If you discover, for whatever reason, an individual was left off an AFT return you need to amend the AFT return for the quarter in which the tax charge actually arose. Do not simply add the individual to the next AFT return that is filed.</p><p>If:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>an amendment is being made to an AFT return that was originally submitted before 6 April 2011 and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>it relates to an individual liable to the lifetime allowance charge already reported on the AFT return</p></li><p>the scheme administrator does not have to provide the member&#8217;s National Insurance number (NINO). If the scheme administrator did not originally give the individual&#8217;s NINO and now wishes to supply it they can do so - but they don&#8217;t have to. To enter the NINO using Pension Schemes Online the scheme administrator will need to delete the individual&#8217;s date of birth before submitting the amendment to the AFT return.</p><h3>Penalties for incorrect information</h3><p>Schedule 24 Finance Act 2007</p><p>The Finance Act 2008, Schedule 40 (Appointed Day, Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Order 2009 - SI 2009/57</p><p>For AFT returns for quarters ending 31 March 2010 onwards a penalty is due on the scheme administrator if the AFT return understates the amount of tax actually due, and</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the inaccuracy was deliberate or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the scheme administrator did not take reasonable care in completing the AFT return, or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the scheme administrator discovers they have made mistake on the AFT return and does not take reasonable steps to tell HMRC about the mistake.</p></li><p>The amount of the penalty depends on the behaviour of the scheme administrator.</p><p>The legislation governing these penalties covers many taxpayers and types of tax.
