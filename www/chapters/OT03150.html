The method of calculation is set out in OTA75\\S2. The legislation uses the terms positive amounts and negative amounts. These are basically incomings (positives) and expenditure and certain specific reliefs (negatives). It should be noted that some items, e.g. the licence debit or credit for the period, can be either a positive or a negative element in the computation.
