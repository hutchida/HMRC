The guide is presented as follows.</p><sup>1</sup><h4>General guidance</h4><sup>2</sup><p> You must have the COTAX CT Co-ordinator role to carry out all the required actions.</p><sup>3</sup><p>The caseworker must give you full instructions on the entries that are needed in the closure notice and the CT chargeable figure that will result.</p><sup>4</sup><h4>Initial actions</h4><sup>5</sup><p> Do your instructions from the caseworker show that the conclusion the enquiry means that the self assessment figures need to be amended?</p><sup>6</sup><p>If yes, go to step 3.</p><sup>7</sup><p>If no, go to step 10.</p><sup>8</sup><p> Has the caseworker advised you that there is a jeopardy amendment with an outstanding appeal?</p><sup>9</sup><p>If yes, go to step 14.</p><sup>10</sup><p>If no, go to step 4.</p><sup>11</sup><p> Do your instructions show that the AP structure needs to be amended because the return under enquiry has been made for the wrong period?</p><sup>12</sup><p>If yes, go to step 16.</p><sup>13</sup><p>If no, go to step 5.</p><sup>14</sup><h4>Using COTAX to prepare the closure notice</h4><sup>15</sup><p>If the figure does not agree, use the button to produce a printout of the screen and refer it to the caseworker for further guidance. Use the button to abandon RAMA until you get fresh instructions.</p><sup>16</sup><p>If the enquiry is recorded in Caseflow and you have access to that system, ask the caseworker to allocate the task to you and follow the guidance on the Enforcement &amp; Compliance intranet site by following the Caseflow ‘Useful link’ and then the Caseflow Guidance link.</p><sup>17</sup><p>If the enquiry is recorded on CQI and you have access to that system, follow the guidance in the Managing Compliance Guide at MCG731.</p><sup>18</sup><p>Top of page</p><sup>19</sup><h4>You need to record the issue of a manual assessment</h4><sup>20</sup><p>You must carry out these actions on the same day that the manual closure notice with revenue amendment is issued.</p><sup>21</sup><p>10. Use function MRSC (Maintain Rept / Realloc Signals (Company)) to inhibit reallocations or repayments to or from any AP of the company.</p><sup>22</sup><p>11. Use function RAMA (Record / Amend Assessment). Select the ‘closure notice with rev amdt’ option. Enter the figures supplied by the caseworker.</p><sup>23</sup><p>If the caseworker has asked you to provide a printout of the calculation to help them prepare the manual closure notice, use the button when you have entered the figures and clicked .</p><sup>24</sup><p>On screen COT121G select ‘record manual issue’ from the ‘do you want to?’ field and enter today’s date as the date of issue.</p><sup>25</sup><p>12. Deal with any penalty as instructed by the caseworker then go to step 9.</p><sup>26</sup><p>Top of page</p><sup>27</sup><h4>There is an appeal against a jeopardy amendment on the AP</h4><sup>28</sup><p>13. Check for any action required at step 4 then follow the guidance at step 5.</p><sup>29</sup><p>14. On screen COT121G in function RAMA, show how the appeal is determined as instructed by the caseworker then go to step 9.</p><sup>30</sup><p>Top of page</p><sup>31</sup><h4>You need to amend the AP structure before you can issue the closure notice</h4><sup>32</sup><p>15. Use function MRSC (Maintain Repay / Realloc Signals (Company)) to inhibit automatic repayments and reallocations for all APs.</p><sup>33</sup><p>16. Use function MAPS (Maintain AP Signals). Select the AP the caseworker has told you to supersede, select the [SA Enquiry Details] button and change the ‘enquiry in progress’ signal to ‘N’.</p><sup>34</sup><p>17. Use function DASS (Display Assessment) to view the assessments on the AP you are going to supersede.</p><sup>35</sup><p>18. Use the button to produce prints of all the assessments as these must be kept in case they are later needed for evidential purposes.</p><sup>36</sup><p>19. If the company tax return for the AP you are going to supersede was submitted electronically, use View CT Returns and takes prints of the CT600 and attachments.</p><sup>37</sup><p>20. Use function URTN (Unlog Return) to unlog the return on the AP that you are going to supersede.</p><sup>38</sup><p>21. Use function MAPD (Maintain AP Dates) to change the structure of the AP record as instructed by the caseworker.</p><sup>39</sup><p>If COTAX cannot automatically link the APs, ask the caseworker for advice.</p><sup>40</sup><p>22. Use function LRTN (Log Return) to log and capture the return onto the correct AP. Do not ask COTAX to issue an acknowledgement as we no longer issue paper acknowledgements.</p><sup>41</sup><p>23. Use function MAPS (Maintain AP signals). Select the correct A, select the [SA Enquiry Details] button, set the ‘enquiry in progress’ signal to ‘Y’, change the ‘started’ date to the original enquiry start date and Enter the enquiry type.</p><sup>42</sup><p>24. Use function MRSC (Maintain Repay / Realloc Signals (Company)) to unset the inhibition on automatic repayments and reallocations for all APs.</p><sup>43</sup><p>25. Check function VPPD (View Payment and Posting Details) to make sure payments have correctly been moved from the superseded AP to the new AP.</p><sup>44</sup><p>If payments need to be moved manually, use function REWD (Direct Reallocation Within COTAX) to do so.</p><sup>45</sup><p>Go to steps 5 to 9.</p><sup>46</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>47</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
