That person could be</p><sup>1</sup><p>a legal person (for example, a body corporate)</p><sup>2</sup><p>a natural person (for example, a sole proprietor), or</p><sup>3</sup><p>a group of persons jointly (for example, a partnership or association of some sort).</p><sup>4</sup><p>In most cases, the question of whether there is a single legal entity will be clear. For example</p><sup>5</sup><p>a sole proprietor claiming that his two shops are separate businesses</p><sup>6</sup><p>a company claiming that its wholesale and retail arms are separate businesses.</p><sup>7</sup><p>An alternative scenario could be a sole proprietor, making taxable supplies in his own name, who claims to be in partnership with another individual (probably a sleeping partner) when he makes a different type of taxable supply. In a scenario like this, you may be able to prove that the partnership is fictitious and that the sole proprietor is actually making all the supplies.</p><sup>8</sup><p>(This content has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000) VTAXPER35000 - Issues to consider: agency and disbursements(This content has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)</p><sup>9</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>10</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
