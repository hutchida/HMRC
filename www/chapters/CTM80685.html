This is because CH can surrender consortium relief only to the extent that CH’s fellow group companies cannot claim the relief. Relief cannot be claimed by CT1 because it has a loss. But CT2 could claim relief for CH’s excess management expenses of £26,000 against its profits of £30,000.

This is because any actual group claims made are taken into account when determining the potential amount of group claims for the purposes of CTA10/S149 (CTM80580).
