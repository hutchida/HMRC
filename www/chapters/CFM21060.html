Financial liabilities will, or will likely, lead to a company paying out cash in the future. But the cash may be received, or paid, via a whole chain of contractual rights or obligations. For example, a company may hold an option to acquire a convertible bond that can be converted into shares that can be sold for cash. So the definitions of financial asset and financial liability in IAS 32 and its equivalent, section 22 of FRS 102, are in general terms.</p><p>Examples of financial assets and financial liabilities are at CFM21070.</p><p>Common examples of financial assets representing a contractual right to receive cash in the future and corresponding financial liabilities representing a contractual obligation to deliver cash in the future are:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>trade receivables and payables;</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>accounts, notes and loans receivable and payable;</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>bonds and other debt instruments held or issued.</p></li><p>In each case, one party&#8217;s contractual right to receive (or obligation to pay) cash is matched by the other party&#8217;s corresponding obligation to pay (or right to receive), meaning that each case is an example of a financial instrument.</p><p>The meaning of equity instrumentis discussed at CFM21100.</p><h3>Derivatives</h3><p>A derivativeis a particular type of financial instrument whose value changes in response to changes in the value of some underlying subject matter.
