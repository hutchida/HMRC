This caters for certain cases where a share is designed to produce an interest-like return. The return can be in any form (other than purely increases in value catered for by CTA09/S527), but is most likely to be fixed rate dividends on redeemable preference shares. But because such shares are commonly used for genuine commercial financing arrangements not involving tax avoidance, the redemption return condition has a number of filters described at</p><sup>3</sup><p>CTA09/S529 provides that the redemption return condition is that the share is:</p><sup>4</sup><p>redeemable,</p><sup>5</sup><p>designed to produce a return which equates, in substance, to the return on an investment of money at a commercial rate of interest (see CFM45090), and</p><sup>6</sup><p>not an excepted share (see</p><sup>7</sup><p>For these purposes, a share is regarded as redeemable only if it is redeemable as a result of its terms of issue, or by virtue of any collateral agreements, arrangements or understandings, which</p><sup>8</sup><p>require redemption,</p><sup>9</sup><p>entitle the holder to require redemption, or</p><sup>10</sup><p>entitle the issuer to redeem.</p><sup>11</sup><p>In other words, there have to be specific terms or agreements under which the shares can or will be redeemed.</p><sup>12</sup><h3>Example</h3><sup>13</sup><p>Company A wishes to invest spare cash and unconnected company B wishes to borrow money for a period of one year. As company B has tax losses, it does not need the tax relief available for paying interest on its borrowings, and so the two companies agree to share the benefit of B’s tax losses to mutual benefit. Instead of company A simply lending its cash to company B at, say 5%, they agree that company A will subscribe for fixed rate preference shares which will redeem in a year’s time. The dividends are fixed at 4.5%, reflecting the fact that company A will not be taxed on the dividends because of ICTA88/S208 (thus sharing the tax advantage with company B). Effectively, the two companies are sharing the benefit of company B’s losses.</p><sup>14</sup><p>Company A will be holding the shares for an unallowable purpose, since it is seeking a tax advantage in the form of non-taxable income, so the shares are not ‘excepted shares’. Therefore S529 will apply to treat the shares as a creditor loan relationship in the hands of company A. The result is that Company A will be effectively taxed on the 4.5% ‘interest’ it earns on the cash it invested in the shares.</p><sup>15</sup><p>Company B will not be affected by S526.</p><sup>16</sup><h3>Extended definition of redeemable - 22 March 2006</h3><sup>17</sup><p>FA 2006 extended the definition of redeemable.

It must, as a minimum condition, be reasonable to assume that in the future the share will or might be sold or liquidated by the investing company. There may be regulatory reasons why the shares held by a company could not be sold, or the company in which the investing company holds the shares may carry on activities that form part of the core activities of the group such that it is unreasonable to assume that the shares could be sold without a wider disposal of those core activities by higher tier shareholders.</p><sup>25</sup><h3>Designed to produce a return</h3><sup>26</sup><p>In order for CTA09/S529 to apply, the share must be designed to produce a return which equates, in substance, to the return on an investment of money at a commercial rate of interest.
