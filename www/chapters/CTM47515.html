Assuming that the company is not aware that an application will succeed then prior history of regular applications for IT status would be regarded by HMRC as sufficient evidence that this test was met. In the absence of such a prior history, HMRC would expect that there would be statements in annual accounts or other company documentation issued or made available to investors that it was the company&#8217;s intention to seek section 842 approval or at least board meeting minutes documenting the company&#8217;s intention to seek approval status at the end of the AP.</p><h3>{#IDAMIRCH}The reasonable belief test</h3><p>This test was introduced to ensure that a company with an intention to gain section 842 approval would be required to demonstrate that it had a reasonable belief that the tests would be met and that section 842 approval would be granted.</p><p>In order to satisfy this test, at the time the interest distribution is issued, the company should have a reasonable belief that the conditions for approval in ICTA88/S842(1)(a), (b) and (e) (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM47200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CTM47200</remotelink>) will continue to be met at the end of the AP.
