As such, the application of ICTA88/S422 is limited to loans made to participators in a close company (or their associates) by a company that is, or comes to be, under the control of the close company.</p><sup>7</sup><p>You should construe ICTA88/S422 as one with ICTA88/S419. Any reference in Section 422 to a ‘loan’ includes an advance. Similarly, any reference to a company making a loan includes cases in which a company is, or if it were a close company would be, regarded as making a loan by virtue of ICTA88/S419 (2).</p><sup>8</sup><p>The powers of information in FA89/SCH12 Part 1 (CTM61505) apply to ICTA88/S422 just as they do to ICTA88/S419.</p></div></body></html>
