The reason for this is that the couple cannot marry or become civil partners in law so we cannot say they are living together as husband and wife as they could never be husband and wife or living together as civil partners as they could never be civil partners. The customer will therefore be treated as a single customer.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CCM15020:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CCM15030:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>The law prohibits certain relationships by relatives.
