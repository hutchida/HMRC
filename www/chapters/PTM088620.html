He has &#163;100,000 in the arrangement at that time. The scheme gives Brian the option of taking a scheme pension. When the scheme makes the scheme pension offer they tell Brian his other options. Brian can choose to</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>take the scheme pension offered of &#163;8,000 per annum indexed each year by RPI in return for the funds in the arrangement, or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>use those funds to purchase a lifetime annuity from an insurance company of his choice on the open market.</p></li><p>Brian sees an independent financial advisor and considers what types of annuity are available in the market, and the sort of rates he can obtain, given his circumstances and the funds available. The best lifetime annuity quote Brian can obtain is a level annuity of around &#163;8,000 per annum. Brian is interested in purchasing an investment linked annuity (linked to the Stock Market). This is an annuity where the income goes up and down depending on the performance of the FTSE 100 share index. Brian can have a pension starting at around &#163;8,000 per annum with such an annuity, but future levels may vary (depending on the movement in the FTSE 100 index).</p><p>If Brian chooses the scheme pension he becomes entitled to a pension of &#163;8,000 per annum, increasing by RPI each year, and loses the right to the &#163;100,000 funds held in the arrangement. The liability here is then with the scheme.</p><p>The scheme may, or may not, choose to secure their liability for the pension by purchasing an annuity contract with an insurance company. If they do, the contract will only provide the same income as the scheme pension (&#163;8,000 per annum, increasing by RPI). Brian will not be involved in choosing which insurance company the contract is purchased from.</p><p>The amount of Brian&#8217;s lifetime allowance used up will be calculated by reference to the level of scheme pension payable, not the level of funds given up to secure the entitlement (so it falls within benefit crystallisation event (BCE) 2). The crystallised value of that pension is &#163;160,000 (20&#160;x &#163;8,000) not &#163;100,000. This applies whether or not the scheme liability is secured with an insurance company.</p><p>If Brian declines the scheme pension offer and goes down the lifetime annuity route he must tell the scheme administrator what he wants to do, the type of contract he wants and which insurance company he wants them to purchase the annuity with. The scheme administrator then buys that contract from the relevant insurance company.</p><p>If he chooses the index-linked lifetime annuity discussed above, his income will start at &#163;8,000 per annum. But the income in subsequent years will vary depending on the performance of the underlying funds. The amount of Brian&#8217;s lifetime allowance used up will be calculated by reference to the purchase price of the annuity (as there is no scheme pension entitlement). So it will fall within BCE 4, with the crystallised value being &#163;100,000.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM088620:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Prevention of overlap in a money purchase arrangement</h3><h3>Provision of a scheme pension following payment of drawdown pension</h3><p>The legislation provides rules to ensure that funds held in a registered pension scheme are not tested more than once for lifetime allowance purposes.</p><p>A money purchase scheme may give their members the option of taking a scheme pension following a period of drawdown pension, drawn direct from the scheme. A member designates funds to provide a drawdown pension, with the value of the designated sums or assets being tested for lifetime allowance purposes through BCE 1. Then at a later date funds from that drawdown pension fund or flexi-access drawdown fund are applied to provide a scheme pension, either directly from the scheme or through the involvement of an insurance company.</p><p>The provision of a scheme pension before the member reaches age 75 still triggers a lifetime allowance test through BCE 2. However, the legislation provides that the amount crystallising through BCE 2 is reduced by so much of the amount that crystallised at the earlier BCE 1 as relates to the drawdown funds being applied to provide the scheme pension. If the amount crystallising through BCE 2 is reduced to nil or a negative amount, then no amount has been crystallised and no lifetime allowance has been used up by the scheme pension entitlement arising on BCE 2. A negative result does not mean that the member&#8217;s available lifetime allowance is increased. See the example below.</p><p>Where the scheme pension is provided after the member has reached age 75 there is no BCE 2 as the only BCE that can occur after age 75 is a BCE 3 - see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM088630:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM088630</remotelink>.</p><h3>Where only part of the drawdown pension fund or flexi-access drawdown fund is used to provide a scheme pension, or there have been multiple designations</h3><p>If only part of the drawdown pension fund or flexi-access drawdown fund was used to provide a scheme pension then the above process would work on a pro-rata basis. See example 2 below.</p><p>If the drawdown pension fund or flexi-access drawdown fund the scheme pension is funded from has been generated from multiple designations the position is still the same. You would carry out the apportionment by reference to all the previous amounts that crystallised through BCE 1 related to that fund.</p><h3>Example 1</h3><p>In the 2012-13 tax year Tony uses all the uncrystallised funds from his money purchase arrangement to provide him with pension commencement lump sum and a drawdown pension. The scheme rules allow Tony to opt for a scheme pension at a later date. Tony is paid a lump sum of &#163;187,500 and is left with a drawdown pension fund of &#163;562,500.</p><p>A lifetime allowance test takes place (both BCE 1 and BCE 6 have occurred). The scheme administrator calculates that Tony has used up 50 per cent of the standard lifetime allowance. &#163;187,500 has crystallised through BCE 6 and &#163;562,500 has crystallised through BCE 1.</p><p>In the 2015-16 tax year Tony decides to take up the scheme pension option. Tony has taken no drawdown pension so far, and so, because of investment growth, his drawdown pension fund now stands at &#163;650,000. The scheme pension the scheme will provide Tony with in exchange for this fund is &#163;35,000 per annum.</p><p>The switch to scheme pension triggers a lifetime allowance test through BCE 2. The amount crystallised is calculated by reference to the scheme pension provided. But credit is given for the amount that crystallised when the funds concerned were originally designated to provide Tony with a drawdown pension. No credit is given for the previous lump sum payment as this was valued and tested for lifetime allowance purposes separately to the designation to provide drawdown pension.</p><p>So the amount crystallised is:</p><p>20 x P minus the amount crystallised previously through BCE 1</p><p>20&#160;x &#163;35,000 = &#163;700,000</p><p>&#163;700,000 - &#163;562,500 = &#163;137,500</p><p>In 2015-16 the standard lifetime allowance is &#163;1.25 million. The scheme administrator therefore calculates that Tony has used up another 11 per cent of the standard lifetime allowance.</p><h3>Example 2</h3><p>Taking the example above, but the scheme rules give Tony the option of splitting his benefit provision and only surrendering part of his drawdown pension fund for a scheme pension.</p><p>Tony uses half his drawdown pension fund to secure a scheme pension, giving up &#163;325,000 of his unsecured pension fund for a scheme pension of &#163;17,500 per annum.</p><p>The amount that crystallises through BCE 2 is:</p><p>20 x P minus a proportion of the amount crystallised previously through BCE 1</p><p>20 x &#163;17,500 = &#163;350,000</p><p>As half the drawdown pension fund is being used the scheme administrator would discount the &#163;350,000 by half the amount that crystallised when funds were originally designated to provide drawdown pension. Half of &#163;562,500 is &#163;281,250.</p><p>So the amount that crystallised is</p><p>&#163;350,000 - &#163;281,250 = &#163;68,750</p><p>This represents 5 per cent of the standard lifetime allowance in 2015-16.</p><h3>Where a scheme pension is provided from a drawdown pension fund in existence on 6 April 2006</h3><p>Article 29 The Taxation of Pension Schemes (Transitional Provisions) Order 2006 - SI 2006/572</p><p>Any pension being paid to a member aged under 75 on 5 April 2006:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>as income withdrawal from a personal pension scheme</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>direct from the funds of a small self-administered scheme (SSAS) in accordance with paragraphs 20.39 to 20.42 of the IR12(2001) Practice Notes on the Approval of Occupational Pension Schemes and the scheme rules did not require an annuity to be purchased for the individual</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>direct from the funds of a SSAS approved under s 590 ICTA 1988 where the scheme rules did not require an annuity to be purchased for the individual, or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>as income drawdown to a member aged under 75 from any retirement benefits scheme (including a SSAS) within the requirements laid out in Appendix XII of the IR12(2001) Practice Notes on the Approval of Occupational Pension Schemes.</p></li><p>from a money purchase arrangement in a scheme that becomes a registered pension scheme on 6 April 2006 would have become an unsecured pension from 6 April 2006 onwards, then a drawdown pension from 6 April 2011.

For example scheme pension worth &#163;1 million is provided. Of this, &#163;750,000 of the fund for the scheme pension is derived from an arrangement from the application of funds used to provide income withdrawal from a personal pension before 6 April 2006. So only &#163;250,000 of the scheme pension provision, which has come from uncrystallised rights, is a BCE.</p><p>See <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM088300:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM088300</remotelink> for more details about pre commencement pensions.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM088620:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Ill-health scheme pension ceases or reduces (BCE 2 and BCE3)</h3><p>Paragraph 2(4)(a) Schedule 28 and paragraphs 3, 4 and 7 to 13 Schedule 32 Finance Act 2004</p><p>A scheme pension paid before the normal minimum pension age on grounds of ill-health is tested for lifetime allowance purposes through BCE 2 at the point entitlement arises (using the 20 x P calculation).

This pension is increased each year by RPI, so there is no BCE 3.</p><p>2 years later, Mark recovers from his illness and returns to work.

He has &#163;100,000 in the arrangement at that time. The scheme gives Brian the option of taking a scheme pension. When the scheme makes the scheme pension offer they tell Brian his other options. Brian can choose to</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>take the scheme pension offered of &#163;8,000 per annum indexed each year by RPI in return for the funds in the arrangement, or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>use those funds to purchase a lifetime annuity from an insurance company of his choice on the open market.</p></li><p>Brian sees an independent financial advisor and considers what types of annuity are available in the market, and the sort of rates he can obtain, given his circumstances and the funds available. The best lifetime annuity quote Brian can obtain is a level annuity of around &#163;8,000 per annum. Brian is interested in purchasing an investment linked annuity (linked to the Stock Market). This is an annuity where the income goes up and down depending on the performance of the FTSE 100 share index. Brian can have a pension starting at around &#163;8,000 per annum with such an annuity, but future levels may vary (depending on the movement in the FTSE 100 index).</p><p>If Brian chooses the scheme pension he becomes entitled to a pension of &#163;8,000 per annum, increasing by RPI each year, and loses the right to the &#163;100,000 funds held in the arrangement. The liability here is then with the scheme.</p><p>The scheme may, or may not, choose to secure their liability for the pension by purchasing an annuity contract with an insurance company. If they do, the contract will only provide the same income as the scheme pension (&#163;8,000 per annum, increasing by RPI). Brian will not be involved in choosing which insurance company the contract is purchased from.</p><p>The amount of Brian&#8217;s lifetime allowance used up will be calculated by reference to the level of scheme pension payable, not the level of funds given up to secure the entitlement (so it falls within benefit crystallisation event (BCE) 2). The crystallised value of that pension is &#163;160,000 (20&#160;x &#163;8,000) not &#163;100,000. This applies whether or not the scheme liability is secured with an insurance company.</p><p>If Brian declines the scheme pension offer and goes down the lifetime annuity route he must tell the scheme administrator what he wants to do, the type of contract he wants and which insurance company he wants them to purchase the annuity with. The scheme administrator then buys that contract from the relevant insurance company.</p><p>If he chooses the index-linked lifetime annuity discussed above, his income will start at &#163;8,000 per annum. But the income in subsequent years will vary depending on the performance of the underlying funds. The amount of Brian&#8217;s lifetime allowance used up will be calculated by reference to the purchase price of the annuity (as there is no scheme pension entitlement). So it will fall within BCE 4, with the crystallised value being &#163;100,000.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088620:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Prevention of overlap in a money purchase arrangement</h3><h3>Provision of a scheme pension following payment of drawdown pension</h3><p>The legislation provides rules to ensure that funds held in a registered pension scheme are not tested more than once for lifetime allowance purposes.</p><p>A money purchase scheme may give their members the option of taking a scheme pension following a period of drawdown pension, drawn direct from the scheme. A member designates funds to provide a drawdown pension, with the value of the designated sums or assets being tested for lifetime allowance purposes through BCE 1. Then at a later date funds from that drawdown pension fund or flexi-access drawdown fund are applied to provide a scheme pension, either directly from the scheme or through the involvement of an insurance company.</p><p>The provision of a scheme pension before the member reaches age 75 still triggers a lifetime allowance test through BCE 2. However, the legislation provides that the amount crystallising through BCE 2 is reduced by so much of the amount that crystallised at the earlier BCE 1 as relates to the drawdown funds being applied to provide the scheme pension. If the amount crystallising through BCE 2 is reduced to nil or a negative amount, then no amount has been crystallised and no lifetime allowance has been used up by the scheme pension entitlement arising on BCE 2. A negative result does not mean that the member&#8217;s available lifetime allowance is increased. See the example below.</p><p>Where the scheme pension is provided after the member has reached age 75 there is no BCE 2 as the only BCE that can occur after age 75 is a BCE 3 - see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088630:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM088630</remotelink>.</p><h3>Where only part of the drawdown pension fund or flexi-access drawdown fund is used to provide a scheme pension, or there have been multiple designations</h3><p>If only part of the drawdown pension fund or flexi-access drawdown fund was used to provide a scheme pension then the above process would work on a pro-rata basis. See example 2 below.</p><p>If the drawdown pension fund or flexi-access drawdown fund the scheme pension is funded from has been generated from multiple designations the position is still the same. You would carry out the apportionment by reference to all the previous amounts that crystallised through BCE 1 related to that fund.</p><h3>Example 1</h3><p>In the 2012-13 tax year Tony uses all the uncrystallised funds from his money purchase arrangement to provide him with pension commencement lump sum and a drawdown pension. The scheme rules allow Tony to opt for a scheme pension at a later date. Tony is paid a lump sum of &#163;187,500 and is left with a drawdown pension fund of &#163;562,500.</p><p>A lifetime allowance test takes place (both BCE 1 and BCE 6 have occurred). The scheme administrator calculates that Tony has used up 50 per cent of the standard lifetime allowance. &#163;187,500 has crystallised through BCE 6 and &#163;562,500 has crystallised through BCE 1.</p><p>In the 2015-16 tax year Tony decides to take up the scheme pension option. Tony has taken no drawdown pension so far, and so, because of investment growth, his drawdown pension fund now stands at &#163;650,000. The scheme pension the scheme will provide Tony with in exchange for this fund is &#163;35,000 per annum.</p><p>The switch to scheme pension triggers a lifetime allowance test through BCE 2. The amount crystallised is calculated by reference to the scheme pension provided. But credit is given for the amount that crystallised when the funds concerned were originally designated to provide Tony with a drawdown pension. No credit is given for the previous lump sum payment as this was valued and tested for lifetime allowance purposes separately to the designation to provide drawdown pension.</p><p>So the amount crystallised is:</p><p>20 x P minus the amount crystallised previously through BCE 1</p><p>20&#160;x &#163;35,000 = &#163;700,000</p><p>&#163;700,000 - &#163;562,500 = &#163;137,500</p><p>In 2015-16 the standard lifetime allowance is &#163;1.25 million. The scheme administrator therefore calculates that Tony has used up another 11 per cent of the standard lifetime allowance.</p><h3>Example 2</h3><p>Taking the example above, but the scheme rules give Tony the option of splitting his benefit provision and only surrendering part of his drawdown pension fund for a scheme pension.</p><p>Tony uses half his drawdown pension fund to secure a scheme pension, giving up &#163;325,000 of his unsecured pension fund for a scheme pension of &#163;17,500 per annum.</p><p>The amount that crystallises through BCE 2 is:</p><p>20 x P minus a proportion of the amount crystallised previously through BCE 1</p><p>20 x &#163;17,500 = &#163;350,000</p><p>As half the drawdown pension fund is being used the scheme administrator would discount the &#163;350,000 by half the amount that crystallised when funds were originally designated to provide drawdown pension. Half of &#163;562,500 is &#163;281,250.</p><p>So the amount that crystallised is</p><p>&#163;350,000 - &#163;281,250 = &#163;68,750</p><p>This represents 5 per cent of the standard lifetime allowance in 2015-16.</p><h3>Where a scheme pension is provided from a drawdown pension fund in existence on 6 April 2006</h3><p>Article 29 The Taxation of Pension Schemes (Transitional Provisions) Order 2006 - SI 2006/572</p><p>Any pension being paid to a member aged under 75 on 5 April 2006:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>as income withdrawal from a personal pension scheme</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>direct from the funds of a small self-administered scheme (SSAS) in accordance with paragraphs 20.39 to 20.42 of the IR12(2001) Practice Notes on the Approval of Occupational Pension Schemes and the scheme rules did not require an annuity to be purchased for the individual</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>direct from the funds of a SSAS approved under s 590 ICTA 1988 where the scheme rules did not require an annuity to be purchased for the individual, or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>as income drawdown to a member aged under 75 from any retirement benefits scheme (including a SSAS) within the requirements laid out in Appendix XII of the IR12(2001) Practice Notes on the Approval of Occupational Pension Schemes.</p></li><p>from a money purchase arrangement in a scheme that becomes a registered pension scheme on 6 April 2006 would have become an unsecured pension from 6 April 2006 onwards, then a drawdown pension from 6 April 2011. The sums and assets used for these pension funds are held in a separate &#8216;ring-fenced&#8217; arrangement to which no further contributions may be made.</p><p>Where a scheme pension is later provided from such an arrangement there will be no BCE in respect of so much of the scheme pension that represents the conversion of the drawdown pension to scheme pension. For example scheme pension worth &#163;1 million is provided. Of this, &#163;750,000 of the fund for the scheme pension is derived from an arrangement from the application of funds used to provide income withdrawal from a personal pension before 6 April 2006. So only &#163;250,000 of the scheme pension provision, which has come from uncrystallised rights, is a BCE.</p><p>See <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088300:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM088300</remotelink> for more details about pre commencement pensions.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088620:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Ill-health scheme pension ceases or reduces (BCE 2 and BCE3)</h3><p>Paragraph 2(4)(a) Schedule 28 and paragraphs 3, 4 and 7 to 13 Schedule 32 Finance Act 2004</p><p>A scheme pension paid before the normal minimum pension age on grounds of ill-health is tested for lifetime allowance purposes through BCE 2 at the point entitlement arises (using the 20 x P calculation).
