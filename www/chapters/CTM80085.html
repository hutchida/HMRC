So shares could be devised which had no practical purpose or effect other than to meet the definition of ordinary share capital. As a result of this, the holder might have 51% of the ordinary share capital as defined in Section 832 (1), yet have little economic interest in a company.

In such a scheme, a paying company may be tax exhausted. This means that it has more losses than it can expect to use. This company will not mind whether it pays:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>interest of &#163;100 on a loan, or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>a distribution of &#163;80 and ACT of &#163;20 in respect of shares.</p></li><p>However, the lending company that is liable to CT will normally prefer to receive a dividend on shares that is not taxable. Where there is no Section 247 (1) election, the Revenue receives ACT of &#163;20, while the lending company escapes CT (at the full rate) ofsay &#163;33. However, if the lending company holds shares which:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>have rights which mean they fall within the definition of ordinary share capital, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>bring the borrowing company within the definition of a 51% subsidiary,</p></li><p>then the companies can make a Section 247 (1) election, which ensures that no ACT is payable. </p><p>So a &#8216;lending&#8217; company would acquire enough shares to ensure that it achieved a 51% interest in ordinary share capital. To prevent such abuse FA89/S99 imposed several additional requirements for a company to meet the definition of a 51% subsidiary for Section 247 purposes.
