The following page relates to periods prior to these changes.</p><sup>1</sup><p>Paying and receiving companies can make elections under:</p><sup>2</sup><p>ICTA88/S247 (1) CTM80070,</p><sup>3</sup><p>and</p><sup>4</sup><p>ICTA88/S247 (4) CTM80080,</p><sup>5</sup><p>only where both are bodies corporate resident in the UK. Where the companies are subsidiaries of the same parent company, the parent company must also be resident in theUK.</p><sup>6</sup><p>To determine whether one company is a 51% subsidiary of another, the parent company is not treated as owning share capital either:</p><sup>7</sup><p>directly or indirectly owned in a body corporate not resident in the UK,</p><sup>8</sup><p>or</p><sup>9</sup><p>indirectly owned, where the direct owner is a body corporate for which a profit on the sale of the share capital concerned would be a trading receipt.</p><sup>10</sup><p>In relation to dividends paid prior to 27 July 1989, the test of whether a company is a 51% subsidiary of another for the purposes of Section 247 (1)(a), was defined in terms of a percentage of ordinary share capital, whether held directly or indirectly.</p><sup>11</sup><p>Ordinary share capital is defined in ICTA88/S832 (1) as capital other than that giving a right only to a dividend at a fixed rate. So shares could be devised which had no practical purpose or effect other than to meet the definition of ordinary share capital. As a result of this, the holder might have 51% of the ordinary share capital as defined in Section 832 (1), yet have little economic interest in a company. Dividends could then be paid without accounting for ACT.</p><sup>12</sup><p>This was particularly significant in relation to preference share lending schemes (see CTM15210). In such a scheme, a paying company may be tax exhausted. This means that it has more losses than it can expect to use. This company will not mind whether it pays:</p><sup>13</sup><p>interest of £100 on a loan, or</p><sup>14</sup><p>a distribution of £80 and ACT of £20 in respect of shares.</p><sup>15</sup><p>However, the lending company that is liable to CT will normally prefer to receive a dividend on shares that is not taxable. Where there is no Section 247 (1) election, the Revenue receives ACT of £20, while the lending company escapes CT (at the full rate) ofsay £33. However, if the lending company holds shares which:</p><sup>16</sup><p>have rights which mean they fall within the definition of ordinary share capital, and</p><sup>17</sup><p>bring the borrowing company within the definition of a 51% subsidiary,</p><sup>18</sup><p>then the companies can make a Section 247 (1) election, which ensures that no ACT is payable.</p><sup>19</sup><p>So a ‘lending’ company would acquire enough shares to ensure that it achieved a 51% interest in ordinary share capital. To prevent such abuse FA89/S99 imposed several additional requirements for a company to meet the definition of a 51% subsidiary for Section 247 purposes. These additional requirements are now in ICTA88/S247 (8A) and ICTA88/S247 (9A).
