So a fund with both income and accumulation units should calculate the liability to SDRT for a given charging period for the fund as a whole. Managers of funds with income and accumulation units will probably find it most natural to restate accumulation units in terms of notional income units for this purpose. A record of the conversion calculations will need to be kept for audit purposes.</p><sup>2</sup><p>But funds which have only accumulation units will, of course, have no need to restate them as notional income units.</p><sup>3</sup><p>Switches between income and accumulation units are not to be treated as surrenders under Paragraph 2 FA99/SCH19 but as a type of consolidation or subdivision of units. A charge to SDRT does not arise on a switch between these types of units; accordingly, these switches should not be included in I or S as defined in Paragraph 4(3).</p><sup>4</sup><p>See STSM101020 for the meaning of a unit trust.</p><sup>5</sup><p>See STSM101070 for the meaning of a unit ‘class’.</p><sup>6</sup><p>See STSM104020 for the meaning of the I/S SDRT reduction fraction.</p><sup>7</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>8</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
