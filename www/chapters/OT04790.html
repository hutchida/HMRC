The books etc. which may be required are those which relate to any transaction which may be relevant for the purposes of determining whether a disposal by the participator is a sale at arm&#8217;s length or ascertaining the market value of any oil won by the participator. Where however a company is required to provide books etc. of an overseas subsidiary, the company may apply to the Board to request it to direct that in the circumstances the requirement ought not to have effect. If the Board agree they shall direct that the company need not comply with the requirement.
