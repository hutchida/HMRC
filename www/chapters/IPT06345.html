By notifying BTOps and joining the credit transfer scheme, insurers or their agents can take advantage of an extra 7 days in which to pay. Where the insurer or agent prefers not to use an electronic payment method, we will accept payment by cheque etc which should be received by the return due date. While it is preferable for any cheques to be drawn on a UK bank account we can accept cheques drawn on an overseas account, although insurers or agents need to bear in mind that these may take longer to clear through the banking system. Where payment is received in a foreign currency, including Euros, any exchange rate fluctuation between that currency and Sterling will be borne by the business not by HMRC. Where payments are short, as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, the insurer may become liable to a penalty.
