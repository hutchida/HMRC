Under the agreement, the company agrees to pay the deferred tax liabilities in accordance with the plan along with interest from the normal due date for payment of the tax to the time it is actually paid. Security may be taken for the deferred payments under the plan where HMRC believe there would be a serious risk to collection of tax. This will normally take the form of a bank guarantee. Assessing the risk to collection of tax requires consideration of such factors as whether the tax could be recovered from another group company or controlling director under TCGA92/S190.
