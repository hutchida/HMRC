The solicitor etc will register the company at Companies House and pay any fees on the client’s behalf.</p><sup>1</sup><p>The service by the solicitor etc of forming a new company is standard rated. However, if the business gives instructions for the limited company to be formed before its registration takes place, any registration fee/capital duty paid by the solicitor on behalf of the business and recharged to them is a disbursement and so is not consideration for any supply for VAT purposes.</p><sup>2</sup><h4>Ready-made companies</h4><sup>3</sup><p>Since forming a new limited company can take several weeks, some company registration agents form a number of companies on a speculative basis. They hold these companies in stock, which allows customers to acquire a company registration quickly if needed.</p><sup>4</sup><p>In forming such ‘off the shelf’ limited companies, the agent is not acting on the instructions of a client. Therefore any registration fee/capital duty paid by the agent cannot be passed on to an eventual client as a disbursement. Rather it forms part of the standard rated supply of the ready-made company to the client. This rule also applies to the sale of existing shares which cannot be exempt in these circumstances.</p><sup>5</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
