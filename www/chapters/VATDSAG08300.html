They argued that were two separate entities of</p><sup>1</sup><p>a partnership providing hairdressing services, and</p><sup>2</sup><p>a sole proprietor providing hairdressing products and cards.</p><sup>3</sup><p>In reaching its decision, the Tribunal decided that there were several factors pointing towards there being one business. These included</p><sup>4</sup><p>the lack of a commercial relationship between the two businesses</p><sup>5</sup><p>the fact that there was a single bank account</p><sup>6</sup><p>the fact that no cross-charge was made for use of the facilities.</p><sup>7</sup><p>In commenting on the appellantsâ€™ view that there were two businesses, the Tribunal concluded that, although the appellants had intended to create two separate businesses, they had not done enough to create them. This is a useful observation to apply in similar cases.</p><sup>8</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>9</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
