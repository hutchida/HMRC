One or more companies may be participators in both fields. If all of the participators in the two fields are identical, the arrangements between the fields are unlikely to be effective for PRT purposes on general principles of contract law. Where not all of the participators are in both fields, it is possible to look at the transaction in two ways, namely</p><li><lilabel>1</lilabel><p>to take the view that the companies who are the owners of the asset could in principle enter into an agreement with the companies in the other field and to treat the payment and receipt as tax-effective in full, each with its own tax consequences, or </p></li><li><lilabel>2</lilabel><p>to disregard the part of the payment from a company to itself on the basis that it is a fiscal nullity, which is known as &#8216;netting-down&#8217;.</p></li><p>Which of these approaches is the correct one for any transaction depends on the facts and the legal relationships involved. Consideration should be given to what, as a matter of law, is the proper construction of the transaction agreement and the agreements governing the relationships of the parties (including the Joint Operating Agreement).
