You should be aware that in such circumstance a formal application for group VAT treatment is required and HMRC must consider each case on its own merits. We would also expect a detailed explanation as to why a formal application was not submitted previously, how supplies have been treated between companies and how VAT has been accounted for.

If the group is partly exempt, this could result in significant loss of revenue relative to separate VAT registrations. Inclusion may be allowed from a current date, but if it is, it will be necessary to establish whether the company should have been registered separately up to the current Group inclusion date. Each application for retrospective VAT grouping should be considered on its own merits. Applications should be treated equally regardless of who identified that the ‘VAT grouping’ is unauthorised (HMRC or the companies themselves). You need to be aware that HMRC may need to consider the issue of assessments and penalties if applications for retrospection are refused.</p><sup>4</sup><p>The factors that should normally apply when considering a request for retrospective VAT grouping are:</p><sup>5</sup><p>whether VAT grouping would have been granted at the time;</p><sup>6</sup><p>whether VAT grouping would lead to objectionable results in any way, for example it facilitates avoidance;</p><sup>7</sup><p>the business must demonstrate that there was a genuine misunderstanding or error which led to their failure to apply for grouping.

You should consider each business’ circumstances separately and think about how a First Tier Tribunal judge might regard those circumstances should the business appeal against a decision to refuse the request.</p><sup>12</sup><p>The test of any decision is that it is reasonable and proportionate in all the circumstances of the case.</p><sup>13</sup><p>It is important that you:</p><sup>14</sup><p>take account of all relevant factors;</p><sup>15</sup><p>don’t allow irrelevant factors to prejudice your judgement;</p><sup>16</sup><p>weigh the impact, if any, which granting the request would have on the extra administration costs for the business and HMRC against the inconvenience of recreating the VAT position.</p><sup>17</sup><p>You should keep a written record of every decision – this is particularly important where you have refused the request.
