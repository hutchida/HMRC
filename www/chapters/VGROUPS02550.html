Although all the conditions may have been fulfilled throughout, the companies have not applied for, nor been granted, group treatment. Where it comes to our attention that this has happened HMRC would expect co-operation from the businesses as we carry out our investigation. You should be aware that in such circumstance a formal application for group VAT treatment is required and HMRC must consider each case on its own merits. We would also expect a detailed explanation as to why a formal application was not submitted previously, how supplies have been treated between companies and how VAT has been accounted for.

If the group is partly exempt, this could result in significant loss of revenue relative to separate VAT registrations. Inclusion may be allowed from a current date, but if it is, it will be necessary to establish whether the company should have been registered separately up to the current Group inclusion date. Each application for retrospective VAT grouping should be considered on its own merits. Applications should be treated equally regardless of who identified that the &#8216;VAT grouping&#8217; is unauthorised (HMRC or the companies themselves). You need to be aware that HMRC may need to consider the issue of assessments and penalties if applications for retrospection are refused.</p><p>The factors that should normally apply when considering a request for retrospective VAT grouping are:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>whether VAT grouping would have been granted at the time;</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>whether VAT grouping would lead to objectionable results in any way, for example it facilitates avoidance;</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the business must demonstrate that there was a genuine misunderstanding or error which led to their failure to apply for grouping.
