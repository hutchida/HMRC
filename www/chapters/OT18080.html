And the provision enables the new participator (i.e. C) to calculate its ‘5% test’ by reference to all its predecessors’ oil and gas (i.e. A’s and B’s), see OT18070.</p><sup>5</sup><h4>Where A transfers a part-interest to B and, later, another part-interest to C</h4><sup>6</sup><p>FA80\SCH17\PARA10(1)(b) provides that the transfer of expenditure etc. on second and subsequent transfers of interest, shall be effected after the deduction of sums previously transferred.</p><sup>7</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>8</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
