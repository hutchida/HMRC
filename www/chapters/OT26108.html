This is defined in CTA2010\\S308 as a company which is carrying on a ring fence trade or engaged in any activity with a view to carrying on a ring fence trade (which is explained at <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT21002:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT21002</remotelink> onwards).</p><p>A qualifying company can claim RFES in respect of </p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>qualifying expenditure incurred before the ring fence trade is set up and commenced, </p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>ring fence trade losses, and </p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>some or all of the supplement (RFES and EES) allowed for earlier periods. </p></li><p>RFES increases the value of unused expenditure carried forward from one period to another (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT26110:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT26110</remotelink>). At introduction the rate of RFES (the &#8216;relevant percentage&#8217;) was 6 precent per annum. The rate increased to 10 percent for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012. RFES can be claimed in respect of not more than six accounting periods, but these need not be consecutive (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT26120:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT26120</remotelink>).</p><p>The time limits for making RFES claims are the same as time limits for claiming group relief, as set out in FA98\\Sch18\\para74 (generally within 12 months of the filing date for the company&#8217;s tax return).</p><p>There are separate rules for pre-commencement expenditure (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT26130:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT26130</remotelink>) and for losses arising after the ring fence trade has started (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT26155:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT26155</remotelink>). </p><p>For pre-commencement supplement, a &#8216;mixed pool&#8217; is set up which includes qualifying pre-trading expenditure and any amounts carried forward by the company from its EES mixed pool (which is broadly, qualifying E&amp;A expenditure and any pre-commencement EES already claimed). Cumulative RFES can be claimed on the pooled amount in the first year of ring fence trading. The pre-commencement rules also contain special provisions to deal with disposals of assets for which allowances under CAA2001 are due before trading begins. </p><p>For post-commencement supplement, a &#8216;ring fence pool&#8217; is set up, which includes unrelieved ring fence losses and amounts of E&amp;A expenditure that qualified for EES.
