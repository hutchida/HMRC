It applies where:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>a close company makes a loan or advance which does not otherwise give rise to any charge under CTA10/S455 (1),</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>some person other than the close company makes a payment or transfers property to or releases or satisfies (wholly or partly) a liability of an individual who is a participator or an associate of a participator,</p></li><p>and </p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the two events, loan and payment/release/satisfaction, are part of arrangements made by any person </p></li><h3>Example 1</h3><p>Company D is a close company. Instead of making a loan directly to X, an individual participator, it makes it to an associated company, Company E. Company E then passes the loan to X. The loan by one company to the other is treated as if it had been made direct to X. </p><p>CTA10/S459 was enacted specifically to cover this situation (loan followed by loan) though it also covers other indirect transfers of value.</p><h3>Example 2</h3><p>Company T, a close company, makes a loan to A. A is an individual participator in Company W but not in Company T. Company W, acting in concert with Company T, then makes a loan to D, an individual participator in Company T. Company T and Company W have swapped loans to participators and are treated by CTA10/S459 as if they had each made loans to their own participators.</p><p>Consideration should be given to whether Section 459 could be applied to loans to partnerships that are not otherwise chargeable (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM61520:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CTM61520</remotelink>) and, similarly, to loans to employee share schemes/employee benefit trusts etc where Section 455 (1) does not apply (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM61525:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CTM61525</remotelink>).</p><p>It should also be considered in management buy-out situations. In many cases the close company makes a loan to the new owners who then use those funds to pay the outgoing shareholders for their shares. Whilst this can be a difficult area in which the facts are absolutely crucial, it is exactly the type of arrangement which should be chargeable under Section 455. The company&#8217;s own money is being used to buy out the existing shareholders.</p><p>When CTA10/S459 applies, the close company should be assessed in the usual way and <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM61600:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CTM61600</remotelink> onwards apply.</p><p>CTA10/S459 is subject to <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM61555:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CTM61555</remotelink> and does not apply where a person makes these arrangements in the ordinary course of their business.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM61545:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM61555:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><h3>CTA10/S459</h3><p>Section 459 deals with some loan arrangements where the loan is not made directly to an individual participator in the company (or an associate of a participator).
