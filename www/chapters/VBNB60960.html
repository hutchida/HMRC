Some of the Unions are completely independent of the parent universities. All are in effect autonomous bodies even though provision may be made for them in the constitution of a university or college. Their aims are educational, recreational and representational.</p><p>Junior Common Rooms (JCRs) at Colleges of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge are identical for VAT purposes to Student Unions at non-collegiate universities. The VAT treatment described in this part is also appropriate for JCRs and for University Athletic Unions which function as Student Unions with regard to sports activities.</p><h3>Registration of Unions</h3><p>Since the business activities of Student Unions are effectively independent of those of their parent institutions they should normally be registered separately for VAT in their own names.</p><p>Exceptionally a Union (other than a Union which is completely independent of a university) may be included in the VAT registration of its parent institution if the institution agrees.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>a. Grants</p><p>A substantial part of a Union&#8217;s funding usually comes from the parent institution in the form of a block grant (usually called a &#8216;subvention&#8217;) or capitation fee. These grants are outside the scope of VAT, and any supplies of goods or services which are wholly funded by such grants are not made in the course of business.</p><p>b. Subscriptions</p><p>Subscriptions levied to members may include an element which is passed on to the National Union of Students as an affiliation fee. Such a payment is outside the scope of VAT for the Student Union because the NUS accounts for VAT on it. The rest of the subscription should be apportioned to reflect the nature of the supplies made to the members.</p><h3>Clubs and societies</h3><p>These may or may not be part of the Student Union.</p><p>If a club or society is part the Union has to account for VAT on any supplies the club or society makes. If the club or society is not part it will be treated according to the normal registration rules.</p><p>If the club or society does not consolidate its accounts with those of the Student Union it is a sign that it may not be part. The club or society will need to provide evidence of its independent identity.</p><p>Any difficulties with this issue should be referred by VAT staff to Registration Policy in VATAPPS. The normal route for HMRC staff for this is through the General Advice Request (GAR) or Technical Advice Request (TAR) as outlined at Indirect Tax &#8211; Getting advice about VAT and IPT.</p><p>Any submission should include:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>a copy of the constitution of the club concerned;</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>details of the Union to which it is affiliated or from which it claims to be independent;</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>and, where applicable, a copy of the rules or written constitution of that Union.</p></li><h3>Clubs and societies which are part of a Student Union</h3><p>Clubs with no degree of autonomy in the control of their affairs </p><p>These are automatically part of the Student Union VAT registration.
