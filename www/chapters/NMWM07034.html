It is therefore possible to determine that the worker has an annual salary of &#163;36,000 (&#163;3000 x 12). It is not possible to calculate the worker&#8217;s annual salary if the ONLY information available is a weekly wage or a weekly wage for a set number of weekly hours. This is because 52 weekly payments do not cover all the worker&#8217;s basic hours in a full annual period.</p></li><p>&#160;</p><p>Top of page</p><h3>Performance bonuses and other payments for the basic annual hours</h3><p>For a worker to be performing salaried hours work, he must only be entitled to be paid for his basic annual hours:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>His annual salary, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>A performance bonus (if awarded) (NMWM09140)</p></li><p>For example, a worker who gets an above average performance marking and receives a bonus payment as a result can still be performing salaried hours work (provided all the other conditions for salaried hours work are met).
