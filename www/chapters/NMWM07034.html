It is therefore possible to determine that the worker has an annual salary of £36,000 (£3000 x 12). It is not possible to calculate the worker’s annual salary if the ONLY information available is a weekly wage or a weekly wage for a set number of weekly hours. This is because 52 weekly payments do not cover all the worker’s basic hours in a full annual period.</p><sup>8</sup><p></p><sup>9</sup><p>Top of page</p><sup>10</sup><h4>Performance bonuses and other payments for the basic annual hours</h4><sup>11</sup><p>For a worker to be performing salaried hours work, he must only be entitled to be paid for his basic annual hours:</p><sup>12</sup><p>His annual salary, and</p><sup>13</sup><p>A performance bonus (if awarded) (NMWM09140)</p><sup>14</sup><p>For example, a worker who gets an above average performance marking and receives a bonus payment as a result can still be performing salaried hours work (provided all the other conditions for salaried hours work are met).
