However, it will only become a pension commencement lump sum and therefore an authorised payment when the entitlement arises. For the purposes of valuation against the lifetime allowance, the amount crystallised by the pension commencement lump sum is the amount which was paid.

He draws a &#163;50,000 pension commencement lump sum and uses the rest to provide a drawdown pension. After the payment of the lump sum, Tim has uncrystallised funds of &#163;150,000 and a flexi-access drawdown fund of &#163;150,000 under the arrangement.</p><p>In March 2016, Tim&#8217;s uncrystallised funds stand at &#163;160,000 (the additional &#163;10,000 being attributable to investment growth and income) and his drawdown pension fund has reduced to &#163;120,000. His total fund under the arrangement is therefore &#163;280,000 at this point.</p><p>Tim decides to buy a lifetime annuity contract with all the &#163;280,000 funds held in the arrangement, i.e. with both his uncrystallised funds and drawdown pension fund.</p><p>For pension commencement lump sum purposes the &#163;120,000 flexi-access drawdown fund used to purchase the annuity is excluded from the applicable amount calculation.</p><p>The easiest way to calculate the applicable amount is to simply take 25% of the uncrystallised funds. 25% of &#163;160,000 is &#163;40,000.</p><p>This tallies with the &#8216;one-third of the annuity purchase price&#8217; calculation. Paying a &#163;40,000 pension commencement lump sum leaves an annuity purchase price of &#163;240,000. If you take off from this figure the value of the drawdown pension fund (&#163;120,000) and divide the resulting figure (&#163;120,000) by three, you get &#163;40,000.

Guidance on this is further below.</p><h3>Example 4</h3><p>Stephen has rights under a defined benefits arrangement. He draws benefits on his normal retirement date of 65 when he is entitled under the rules to a scheme pension of &#163;10,000 per annum, and a lump sum of &#163;40,000.</p><p>The scheme administrator calculates the amount that crystallises for lifetime allowance purposes before actually paying benefits (so they can advise Stephen of this fact, and seek confirmation from him that he has available lifetime allowance to cover the amount that will crystallise at the two BCEs).</p><p>The amount that will crystallise for lifetime allowance purposes in respect of the scheme pension entitlement is &#163;200,000 (the relevant valuation factor of 20 times &#163;10,000).</p><p>So the applicable amount is &#163;40,000 (the lump sum) plus &#163;200,000 (the amount crystallising through BCE 2 in respect of the scheme pension), divided by four, which is &#163;60,000.</p><p>Stephen confirms that he has available lifetime allowance to cover the payments for lifetime allowance purposes and is not entitled to an enhanced lifetime allowance. So assuming the lump sum meets all the other requirements, all of the lump sum to be paid represents a pension commencement lump sum and is paid tax-free.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM063240:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Where part of the scheme pension entitlement is commuted to provide the lump sum</h3><p>Where part of the member&#8217;s scheme pension entitlement is given up to generate the lump sum payment, it is the actual post-commutation pension which crystallises for lifetime allowance purposes through BCE 2. It is this that is measured in &#8216;AC&#8217; (see above), not the potential crystallised value of the initial entitlement before commutation.</p><p>Where the commutation factor used by the scheme to calculate the level of pension given up in exchange for the lump sum payment is different from the relevant valuation factor used to calculate the crystallised value of the scheme pension, the resulting &#8216;AC + LS&#8217; figure is not easily identifiable in advance. This is because the lump sum (LS) being generated by the commutation will not be the same as the crystallised value of the scheme pension being given up - therefore the additional &#8216;LS&#8217; generated will be different to the notional reduction in &#8216;AC&#8217;. So the total of &#8216;LS + AC&#8217; will vary depending on the actual level of scheme pension being commuted.</p><p>As generally in these circumstances the scheme rules will simply allow for the payment of the maximum pension commencement lump sum permitted, the applicable amount will not be immediately apparent, as in order to calculate that amount you need to know the actual lump sum that is going to be paid. Until you know what the lump sum payment is you cannot ascertain what the actual reduced scheme pension entitlement will be (and so cannot calculate &#8216;AC&#8217;).</p><p>The applicable amount may be calculated on the following basis, using the known factors of</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the starting, pre-commutation annual rate of scheme pension, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the commutation factor being applied by the scheme.</p></li><p>The applicable amount can be ascertained by using the following equation</p><p>20fg / (20 + 3f)</p><p>f = is the commutation factor being applied by the scheme.</p><p>g = gross scheme pension entitlement before commutation.</p><p>Notes</p><li><lilabel>1</lilabel><p>The statutory formula, HMRC equation and the examples are based on the assumption that the only lump sum the scheme intends to pay is a pension commencement lump sum.</p></li><li><lilabel>2</lilabel><p>When using the equation there may be slight rounding differences compared to the result achieved using the LS + AC/4 formula. These differences are acceptable to HMRC.</p></li><h3>Example 5: the applicable amount where a scheme pension is commuted to provide a lump sum</h3><p>A &#163;50,000 per annum scheme pension entitlement where none of that pension is commuted to provide a lump sum gives an &#8216;LS + AC&#8217; value of &#163;1 million (where using a relevant valuation factor of 20). So 0 + (20 x &#163;50,000).</p><p>Where part of the scheme pension is commuted to provide a &#163;200,000 lump sum, using a commutation factor of 15:1 (&#163;1 of annual pension is given up for every &#163;15 of lump sum paid ), the &#8216;LS + AC&#8217; calculation comes to only &#163;933,340. This figure is arrived at as follows.</p><p>The &#8216;LS&#8217; value is &#163;200,000.</p><p>The reduced scheme pension entitlement is now &#163;36,667 (as, using the 15:1 commutation factor, &#163;13,333 pension is commuted to provide the &#163;200,000 lump sum).</p><p>So &#8216;AC&#8217; is 20 x &#163;36,667 = &#163;733,340.</p><p>So using the formula (LS + AC)/ 4 the applicable amount is</p><p>(&#163;200,000 + &#163;733,340)/ 4 = &#163;233,335. So the entire lump sum counts as a pension commencement lump sum (assuming no previous BCEs have occurred).</p><h3>Example 6: the applicable amount where a scheme pension is commuted to provide a lump sum</h3><p>The scheme pension entitlement before commutation is &#163;30,000 per annum.</p><p>The commutation factor being applied is 15:1 (&#163;1 of annual pension is given up for every &#163;15 of lump sum paid).</p><p>The maximum pension commencement lump sum that can be paid is &#163;138,461.</p><p>This is calculated as follows using the equation</p><p>20fg / (20 + 3f)</p><p>20 x 15 x 30,000 /divided by 20 + (3 x 15).</p><p>Or &#163;9,000,000 /divided by 65.</p><p>The net pension after commutation will be &#163;20,769 per annum (&#163;30,000 minus &#163;138,461/15).</p><p>The net pension figure is then used in the LS + AC/4 formula.</p><p>&#8216;AC&#8217; = &#163;415,380 (&#163;20,769 x 20).</p><p>&#8216;LS + AC&#8217; = &#163;553,841 (&#163;138,461 + &#163;415,380).</p><p>A quarter of this brings us to &#163;138,460.25.</p><p>This figure also represents a third of &#8216;AC&#8217;, so we can see that the &#8216;LS + AC/4&#8217; formula is essentially achieving the same result as where dealing with a lifetime annuity or income withdrawal entitlement.</p><p>Notes</p><li><lilabel>1</lilabel><p>The statutory formula, HMRC equation and the examples are based on the assumption that the only lump sum the scheme intends to pay is a pension commencement lump sum.</p></li><li><lilabel>2</lilabel><p>When using the equation there may be slight rounding differences compared to the result achieved using the LS + AC/4 formula. These differences are acceptable to HMRC.</p></li><h3>Example 7: the applicable amount where a scheme pension is commuted to provide a lump sum and the lump sum exceeds the permitted maximum</h3><p>The member of a defined benefits arrangement in accordance with their scheme rules receives a scheme pension after commutation of &#163;15,000 and a lump sum of &#163;105,000 is paid in connection with the pension.</p><p>The scheme administrator realises that the lump sum may exceed the pension commencement lump sum permitted maximum. The lump sum satisfies the other conditions for being a pension commencement lump sum (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM063200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM063200</remotelink>).</p><p>A scheme can pay a lump sum in excess of the permitted maximum but if it does so any amount over the permitted maximum will not be a pension commencement lump sum (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM063230:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM063230</remotelink>).</p><p>To decide how much of the lump sum can be paid as a pension commencement lump sum, the scheme administrator applies the LS + AC/4 formula.</p><p>LS is the &#163;105,000 paid to the member.</p><p>AC is the &#163;15,000 scheme pension x 20 = &#163;300,000.</p><p>So the applicable amount is &#163;(105,000 + 300,000)/4 = &#163;101,250.</p><p>The scheme administrator establishes that the member had &#163;1 million available lifetime allowance at the time he took his benefits. So the available portion is &#163;250,000. As the applicable amount is lower than the available portion, the member&#8217;s permitted maximum is the applicable amount of &#163;101,250 (see above).</p><p>The member was paid a lump sum of &#163;105,000. The excess over the applicable amount (&#163;3,750) is not a pension commencement lump sum. As, for the purposes of this example, it cannot be paid as any other authorised lump sum payment (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM061200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM061200</remotelink>) it will be an unauthorised payment subject to the unauthorised payments tax charges (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM134100:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM134100</remotelink> for details of these charges).</p><p>Note: Had the trustees wished to avoid making an unauthorised payment and ensure the entire lump sum paid counted as pension commencement lump sum they would need to ensure that the lump sum paid to the member is no more than 25% of LS + AC.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM063240:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Deductions to the applicable amount where dealing with a scheme pension</h3><p>Paragraph 3(7) and (8) Schedule 29 Finance Act 2004</p><p>Paragraph 35(3) Schedule 10 Finance Act 2005</p><p>In calculating the applicable amount, the following deductions must be made:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>amounts attributable to a disqualifying pension credit, or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>amounts derived from sums and assets in a drawdown pension fund or flexi-access drawdown fund that have funded a scheme pension (in cases where an entitlement to a scheme pension arises under a money purchase arrangement).</p></li><p>In the case of a money purchase benefit, the deduction is from the scheme pension purchase price (before it is later divided by 3). That is, in looking at the purchase price of the scheme pension, do not include any funds that relate to the exclusions bulleted above.</p><p>In the case of a defined benefit, the deduction is from the &#8216;LS + AC&#8217; formula.</p><p>The examples above show how this works for defined benefits where the scheme provides separate pension and lump sum, i.e. where there is no commutation of pension. Where defined benefits allow a lump sum only by commutation of pension, then the above exclusion means that the part of the pre-commutation pension that relates to the excluded item becomes non-commutable. In such a case you can use a similar approach to that explained earlier (the 20fg/20 + 3f formula). But in this case a new variable (&#8216;h&#8217;) has to be factored in</p><p>20fgh / (20 + 3f)</p><p>f = the commutation factor being applied by the scheme.</p><p>g = the gross scheme pension entitlement before commutation.</p><p>h = the fraction of the scheme pension entitlement that is commutable.</p><h3>Example 8</h3><p>John has a &#163;30,000 lump sum entitlement under a defined benefits arrangement and a &#163;15,000 per annum scheme pension entitlement. No pension needs to be commuted to generate the lump sum entitlement.</p><p>One third of his pension entitlement is derived from a disqualifying pension credit. So &#163;5,000 of his annual pension entitlement is excluded from the applicable amount calculation. This means only &#163;10,000 of the scheme pension entitlement is included in the applicable amount calculation.</p><p>The maximum permitted pension commencement lump sum payable is &#163;57,500. This is calculated as follows using the LS + AC/4 formula.</p><p>LS is &#163;30,000.</p><p>AC is 20 x &#163;10,000 = &#163;200,000</p><p>LS + AC is &#163;30,000 + &#163;200,000 = &#163;230,000</p><p>&#163;230,000/4 = &#163;57,500.</p><p>So the &#163;30,000 entitlement is within the applicable amount margin.</p><h3>Example 9</h3><p>Stephanie holds &#163;200,000 of uncrystallised funds under a money purchase arrangement. &#163;100,000 of these funds represent a disqualifying pension credit. The scheme offers Stephanie the opportunity to give up those funds in return for a &#163;12,500 per annum scheme pension; effectively using a 16:1 commutation factor. Stephanie can commute part of her pension entitlement using a commutation factor of 16:1 to generate a pension commencement lump sum up to the permitted maximum.</p><p>Using the formula (20fgh / 20 + 3f) the scheme administrator calculates that the applicable amount is &#163;29,412. This is based on:</p><p>f = the scheme commutation factor of 16</p><p>g = the scheme pension before commutation of &#163;12,500</p><p>h = 0.5 (the fraction of the scheme pension entitlement that is commutable, i.e. not a disqualifying pension credit).</p><p>So 20 x 16 x &#163;12,500 x 0.5 divided by 20 + (3 x 16) = &#163;29,412.</p><p>It can be checked that this balances with the LS + AC/4 formula as follows:</p><p>If a lump sum of &#163;29,412 is paid there is a residual fund of &#163;170,588. Using the scheme commutation factor of 16:1 this generates a residual scheme pension of &#163;10,662. The crystallised value of this (&#8216;AC&#8217;) is &#163;213,235.</p><p>So LS + AC before considering the element of disqualifying pension credit is &#163;242,647 (&#163;29,412 + &#163;213,235).</p><p>This figure is then discounted to reflect the crystallised value of the notional scheme pension entitlement that existed initially that represented a disqualifying pension credit, i.e. the crystallised value of the &#163;12,500 scheme pension that represents the disqualifying pension credit.</p><p>This can be represented by the following formula</p><p>LS + AC - 20g(1 - h)</p><p>So discounting &#8216;LS + AC&#8217; by 20 x &#163;12,500 x 0.5 (1 - 0.5) = &#163;125,000.</p><p>&#163;242,647 - &#163;125,000 = &#163;117,647.

These differences are acceptable to HMRC.</p></li><h3>Prevention of overlap</h3><p>Where the above reduction is being made to reflect the fact that some funds in a drawdown pension fund or flexi-access drawdown fund held under a money purchase arrangement have been applied to provide a scheme pension, then (for the purposes of calculating &#8216;AC&#8217; in determining the applicable amount only) any deduction that will be applied through the operation of the overlap provisions in BCE 2, to reflect the earlier amount (s) that crystallised through BCE 1 (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM088620:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM088620</remotelink>), is ignored. This is to ensure that no double counting occurs when the deduction above is made.</p><p>For example, with a &#163;20,000 per annum scheme pension that is derived in part from a drawdown pension fund or flexi-access drawdown fund, the starting point for calculating &#8216;AC&#8217; would be &#163;400,000 (20 x &#163;20,000) - not &#163;400,000 minus the earlier amounts crystallised through BCE 1 when that drawdown pension fund or flexi-access drawdown fund was created.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM063240:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Abatement of a scheme pension under a public service pension scheme</h3><p>Where a scheme pension being provided under a public service pension scheme is being abated, the level of that abatement is ignored when calculating the amount that crystallises for lifetime allowance purposes through BCE 2 as that pension entitlement arises (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM088620:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM088620</remotelink>).

His total fund under the arrangement is therefore &#163;280,000 at this point.</p><p>Tim decides to buy a lifetime annuity contract with all the &#163;280,000 funds held in the arrangement, i.e. with both his uncrystallised funds and drawdown pension fund.</p><p>For pension commencement lump sum purposes the &#163;120,000 flexi-access drawdown fund used to purchase the annuity is excluded from the applicable amount calculation.</p><p>The easiest way to calculate the applicable amount is to simply take 25% of the uncrystallised funds. 25% of &#163;160,000 is &#163;40,000.</p><p>This tallies with the &#8216;one-third of the annuity purchase price&#8217; calculation.

Guidance on this is further below.</p><h3>Example 4</h3><p>Stephen has rights under a defined benefits arrangement.

So assuming the lump sum meets all the other requirements, all of the lump sum to be paid represents a pension commencement lump sum and is paid tax-free.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM063240:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Where part of the scheme pension entitlement is commuted to provide the lump sum</h3><p>Where part of the member&#8217;s scheme pension entitlement is given up to generate the lump sum payment, it is the actual post-commutation pension which crystallises for lifetime allowance purposes through BCE 2. It is this that is measured in &#8216;AC&#8217; (see above), not the potential crystallised value of the initial entitlement before commutation.</p><p>Where the commutation factor used by the scheme to calculate the level of pension given up in exchange for the lump sum payment is different from the relevant valuation factor used to calculate the crystallised value of the scheme pension, the resulting &#8216;AC + LS&#8217; figure is not easily identifiable in advance. This is because the lump sum (LS) being generated by the commutation will not be the same as the crystallised value of the scheme pension being given up - therefore the additional &#8216;LS&#8217; generated will be different to the notional reduction in &#8216;AC&#8217;. So the total of &#8216;LS + AC&#8217; will vary depending on the actual level of scheme pension being commuted.</p><p>As generally in these circumstances the scheme rules will simply allow for the payment of the maximum pension commencement lump sum permitted, the applicable amount will not be immediately apparent, as in order to calculate that amount you need to know the actual lump sum that is going to be paid.

So 0 + (20 x &#163;50,000).</p><p>Where part of the scheme pension is commuted to provide a &#163;200,000 lump sum, using a commutation factor of 15:1 (&#163;1 of annual pension is given up for every &#163;15 of lump sum paid ), the &#8216;LS + AC&#8217; calculation comes to only &#163;933,340. This figure is arrived at as follows.</p><p>The &#8216;LS&#8217; value is &#163;200,000.</p><p>The reduced scheme pension entitlement is now &#163;36,667 (as, using the 15:1 commutation factor, &#163;13,333 pension is commuted to provide the &#163;200,000 lump sum).</p><p>So &#8216;AC&#8217; is 20 x &#163;36,667 = &#163;733,340.</p><p>So using the formula (LS + AC)/ 4 the applicable amount is</p><p>(&#163;200,000 + &#163;733,340)/ 4 = &#163;233,335. So the entire lump sum counts as a pension commencement lump sum (assuming no previous BCEs have occurred).</p><h3>Example 6: the applicable amount where a scheme pension is commuted to provide a lump sum</h3><p>The scheme pension entitlement before commutation is &#163;30,000 per annum.</p><p>The commutation factor being applied is 15:1 (&#163;1 of annual pension is given up for every &#163;15 of lump sum paid).</p><p>The maximum pension commencement lump sum that can be paid is &#163;138,461.</p><p>This is calculated as follows using the equation</p><p>20fg / (20 + 3f)</p><p>20 x 15 x 30,000 /divided by 20 + (3 x 15).</p><p>Or &#163;9,000,000 /divided by 65.</p><p>The net pension after commutation will be &#163;20,769 per annum (&#163;30,000 minus &#163;138,461/15).</p><p>The net pension figure is then used in the LS + AC/4 formula.</p><p>&#8216;AC&#8217; = &#163;415,380 (&#163;20,769 x 20).</p><p>&#8216;LS + AC&#8217; = &#163;553,841 (&#163;138,461 + &#163;415,380).</p><p>A quarter of this brings us to &#163;138,460.25.</p><p>This figure also represents a third of &#8216;AC&#8217;, so we can see that the &#8216;LS + AC/4&#8217; formula is essentially achieving the same result as where dealing with a lifetime annuity or income withdrawal entitlement.</p><p>Notes</p><li><lilabel>1</lilabel><p>The statutory formula, HMRC equation and the examples are based on the assumption that the only lump sum the scheme intends to pay is a pension commencement lump sum.</p></li><li><lilabel>2</lilabel><p>When using the equation there may be slight rounding differences compared to the result achieved using the LS + AC/4 formula.

The lump sum satisfies the other conditions for being a pension commencement lump sum (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM063200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM063200</remotelink>).</p><p>A scheme can pay a lump sum in excess of the permitted maximum but if it does so any amount over the permitted maximum will not be a pension commencement lump sum (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM063230:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM063230</remotelink>).</p><p>To decide how much of the lump sum can be paid as a pension commencement lump sum, the scheme administrator applies the LS + AC/4 formula.</p><p>LS is the &#163;105,000 paid to the member.</p><p>AC is the &#163;15,000 scheme pension x 20 = &#163;300,000.</p><p>So the applicable amount is &#163;(105,000 + 300,000)/4 = &#163;101,250.</p><p>The scheme administrator establishes that the member had &#163;1 million available lifetime allowance at the time he took his benefits. So the available portion is &#163;250,000. As the applicable amount is lower than the available portion, the member&#8217;s permitted maximum is the applicable amount of &#163;101,250 (see above).</p><p>The member was paid a lump sum of &#163;105,000. The excess over the applicable amount (&#163;3,750) is not a pension commencement lump sum. As, for the purposes of this example, it cannot be paid as any other authorised lump sum payment (see PTM061200) it will be an unauthorised payment subject to the unauthorised payments tax charges (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM134100:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM134100</remotelink> for details of these charges).</p><p>Note: Had the trustees wished to avoid making an unauthorised payment and ensure the entire lump sum paid counted as pension commencement lump sum they would need to ensure that the lump sum paid to the member is no more than 25% of LS + AC.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM063240:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Deductions to the applicable amount where dealing with a scheme pension</h3><p>Paragraph 3(7) and (8) Schedule 29 Finance Act 2004</p><p>Paragraph 35(3) Schedule 10 Finance Act 2005</p><p>In calculating the applicable amount, the following deductions must be made:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>amounts attributable to a disqualifying pension credit, or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>amounts derived from sums and assets in a drawdown pension fund or flexi-access drawdown fund that have funded a scheme pension (in cases where an entitlement to a scheme pension arises under a money purchase arrangement).</p></li><p>In the case of a money purchase benefit, the deduction is from the scheme pension purchase price (before it is later divided by 3).

Where defined benefits allow a lump sum only by commutation of pension, then the above exclusion means that the part of the pre-commutation pension that relates to the excluded item becomes non-commutable. In such a case you can use a similar approach to that explained earlier (the 20fg/20 + 3f formula). But in this case a new variable (&#8216;h&#8217;) has to be factored in</p><p>20fgh / (20 + 3f)</p><p>f = the commutation factor being applied by the scheme.</p><p>g = the gross scheme pension entitlement before commutation.</p><p>h = the fraction of the scheme pension entitlement that is commutable.</p><h3>Example 8</h3><p>John has a &#163;30,000 lump sum entitlement under a defined benefits arrangement and a &#163;15,000 per annum scheme pension entitlement. No pension needs to be commuted to generate the lump sum entitlement.</p><p>One third of his pension entitlement is derived from a disqualifying pension credit. So &#163;5,000 of his annual pension entitlement is excluded from the applicable amount calculation. This means only &#163;10,000 of the scheme pension entitlement is included in the applicable amount calculation.</p><p>The maximum permitted pension commencement lump sum payable is &#163;57,500. This is calculated as follows using the LS + AC/4 formula.</p><p>LS is &#163;30,000.</p><p>AC is 20 x &#163;10,000 = &#163;200,000</p><p>LS + AC is &#163;30,000 + &#163;200,000 = &#163;230,000</p><p>&#163;230,000/4 = &#163;57,500.</p><p>So the &#163;30,000 entitlement is within the applicable amount margin.</p><h3>Example 9</h3><p>Stephanie holds &#163;200,000 of uncrystallised funds under a money purchase arrangement. &#163;100,000 of these funds represent a disqualifying pension credit. The scheme offers Stephanie the opportunity to give up those funds in return for a &#163;12,500 per annum scheme pension; effectively using a 16:1 commutation factor. Stephanie can commute part of her pension entitlement using a commutation factor of 16:1 to generate a pension commencement lump sum up to the permitted maximum.</p><p>Using the formula (20fgh / 20 + 3f) the scheme administrator calculates that the applicable amount is &#163;29,412. This is based on:</p><p>f = the scheme commutation factor of 16</p><p>g = the scheme pension before commutation of &#163;12,500</p><p>h = 0.5 (the fraction of the scheme pension entitlement that is commutable, i.e. not a disqualifying pension credit).</p><p>So 20 x 16 x &#163;12,500 x 0.5 divided by 20 + (3 x 16) = &#163;29,412.</p><p>It can be checked that this balances with the LS + AC/4 formula as follows:</p><p>If a lump sum of &#163;29,412 is paid there is a residual fund of &#163;170,588. Using the scheme commutation factor of 16:1 this generates a residual scheme pension of &#163;10,662. The crystallised value of this (&#8216;AC&#8217;) is &#163;213,235.</p><p>So LS + AC before considering the element of disqualifying pension credit is &#163;242,647 (&#163;29,412 + &#163;213,235).</p><p>This figure is then discounted to reflect the crystallised value of the notional scheme pension entitlement that existed initially that represented a disqualifying pension credit, i.e. the crystallised value of the &#163;12,500 scheme pension that represents the disqualifying pension credit.</p><p>This can be represented by the following formula</p><p>LS + AC - 20g(1 - h)</p><p>So discounting &#8216;LS + AC&#8217; by 20 x &#163;12,500 x 0.5 (1 - 0.5) = &#163;125,000.</p><p>&#163;242,647 - &#163;125,000 = &#163;117,647. A quarter of this is &#163;29,412.</p><p>Notes</p><li><lilabel>1</lilabel><p>The statutory formula, HMRC equation and the examples are based on the assumption that the only lump sum the scheme intends to pay is a pension commencement lump sum.</p></li><li><lilabel>2</lilabel><p>When using the equation there may be slight rounding differences compared to the result achieved using the LS + AC/4 formula. These differences are acceptable to HMRC.</p></li><h3>Prevention of overlap</h3><p>Where the above reduction is being made to reflect the fact that some funds in a drawdown pension fund or flexi-access drawdown fund held under a money purchase arrangement have been applied to provide a scheme pension, then (for the purposes of calculating &#8216;AC&#8217; in determining the applicable amount only) any deduction that will be applied through the operation of the overlap provisions in BCE 2, to reflect the earlier amount (s) that crystallised through BCE 1 (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088620:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM088620</remotelink>), is ignored. This is to ensure that no double counting occurs when the deduction above is made.</p><p>For example, with a &#163;20,000 per annum scheme pension that is derived in part from a drawdown pension fund or flexi-access drawdown fund, the starting point for calculating &#8216;AC&#8217; would be &#163;400,000 (20 x &#163;20,000) - not &#163;400,000 minus the earlier amounts crystallised through BCE 1 when that drawdown pension fund or flexi-access drawdown fund was created.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM063240:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Abatement of a scheme pension under a public service pension scheme</h3><p>Where a scheme pension being provided under a public service pension scheme is being abated, the level of that abatement is ignored when calculating the amount that crystallises for lifetime allowance purposes through BCE 2 as that pension entitlement arises (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088620:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM088620</remotelink>).
