The general effect is that when you bring additional tax into charge, a company has an opportunity to make claims to set against the additional tax liability arising, even though the normal time limit for doing so has passed. However, this opportunity does not apply to claims for the period into which the enquiry was conducted.</p><sup>2</sup><p>Paragraph 61 (1) identifies the relevant amendments and assessments. They are:</p><sup>3</sup><p>a consequential Revenue amendment of a company tax return other than the return enquired into, under FA98/SCH18/PARA34 (2A), (see the Enquiry Manual),</p><sup>4</sup><p>a discovery assessment made under FA98/SCH18/PARA41, (see CTM95030), and</p><sup>5</sup><p>an assessment to recover excess group relief made under FA98/SCH18/PARA76, (see CTM97070).</p><sup>6</sup><p>Under FA98/SCH18/PARA62 (1) the extended time limit for these claims is one year from the end of the “relevant accounting period”. Paragraph 61 (3) defines the “relevant accounting period” as the accounting period in which the Revenue amendment was issued or the assessment was made.</p><sup>7</sup><p>Paragraph 62 (1) also says that a company can vary or revoke a claim previously made or given (unless it is irrevocable).</p><sup>8</sup><p>When a company varies or revokes a claim, it must do so in the same manner in which the claim was made. If the consent of some other person was required for the original claim that other person must also give consent to its revocation.
