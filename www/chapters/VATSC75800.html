However because of the wide definition of supply adopted in this case, the validity of the contract was irrelevant provided that two criteria were met: firstly that there were goods, and secondly that they were passed to someone else for consideration.</p><sup>5</sup><p>In Phillip Drakard Trading (LON/89/1473X) outstanding amounts due on HP agreements for two lorries were paid to the finance companies by a third party when the customer (in financial difficulties) passed the lorries to the third party. There was no transfer of the agreements by the finance companies. The High Court accepted our view that Drakard supplied the lorries to the third party for consideration (the payments to the finance companies) and that VAT was due.</p><sup>6</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>7</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
