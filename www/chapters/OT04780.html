We are advised that any claim can be withdrawn to the extent that a decision has not been taken on it in respect of the withdrawn expenditure. But where a decision has been taken to allow some, or all, of the claimed expenditure, that claim, or part of the claim as appropriate, cannot be withdrawn.

It follows that if a claim for expenditure qualifying for supplement is withdrawn, then so also is any associated supplement claim. To the extent that a decision has not been taken on the claim in respect of expenditure identified as qualifying for supplement, the claimant can withdraw the claim which must include the associated supplement. The claimant may make a fresh claim for the expenditure (subject to the conditions for submitting the claim still being satisfied) without the expenditure necessarily being identified as qualifying for supplement.”</p><sup>8</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>9</sup><p> Next page</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\OT04780.xml</p><hr/><sup>title</sup><h3>Withdrawal Of Claims</h3><sup>0</sup><p>Until 1996, the withdrawal of claims to expenditure/supplement relief was not considered to be specifically authorised under the provisions of OTA75.
