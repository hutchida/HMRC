I am writing now to confirm our change of practice following that advice. We are advised that any claim can be withdrawn to the extent that a decision has not been taken on it in respect of the withdrawn expenditure. But where a decision has been taken to allow some, or all, of the claimed expenditure, that claim, or part of the claim as appropriate, cannot be withdrawn. The withdrawn expenditure may be included in a fresh claim, provided that the conditions for making such a claim are still satisfied (for example that the time limit for claiming the expenditure relief has not expired).</p><p>There is no change in the Board&#8217;s view of a claim for supplement, which, if it is claimed, must be included in a claim for the associated expenditure. It follows that if a claim for expenditure qualifying for supplement is withdrawn, then so also is any associated supplement claim. To the extent that a decision has not been taken on the claim in respect of expenditure identified as qualifying for supplement, the claimant can withdraw the claim which must include the associated supplement. The claimant may make a fresh claim for the expenditure (subject to the conditions for submitting the claim still being satisfied) without the expenditure necessarily being identified as qualifying for supplement.&#8221;</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT04750:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT04785:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>Until 1996, the withdrawal of claims to expenditure/supplement relief was not considered to be specifically authorised under the provisions of OTA75.
