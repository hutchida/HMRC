However, under Regulation 20(c) of the VAT General Regulations 1995, the supplier is prevented from issuing a tax invoice for any supply on which, although the supply is not made for consideration, tax is due. As a result the recipient of the gift may use it in the course of their business but be unable to make any input tax claim because of the lack of a tax invoice. As output tax will have been received in respect of the gift, it would be inequitable for input tax to be blocked.</p><sup>1</sup><p> Previous page</p></div></body></html>
