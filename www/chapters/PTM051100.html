If the amount being claimed in one tax year is seemingly over the annual allowance for that year the amount of relief given out is not restricted to the annual allowance. Provided all the necessary conditions are met, relief is given on either &#163;3,600 or (more likely in this case) the total of the individual&#8217;s relevant UK earnings, whichever is the greater. <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM040000:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM040000</remotelink> has more information about tax relief given to pension contributions.</p><p>Pension savings are tested against the annual allowance differently depending on the type of arrangement. For other money purchase arrangements and hybrid arrangements that might provide other money purchase benefits, it is the actual amount of contributions that are tested. For other types of arrangements (e.g. defined benefits) it is the increase in the value of benefit rights that is tested not the amount of contributions.</p><p>If a member&#8217;s pension saving is more than the annual allowance they will pay a tax charge on the amount over the annual allowance.

High pensionable pay and high accrual rates also result in higher pension savings.

If the amount being claimed in one tax year is seemingly over the annual allowance for that year the amount of relief given out is not restricted to the annual allowance. Provided all the necessary conditions are met, relief is given on either &#163;3,600 or (more likely in this case) the total of the individual&#8217;s relevant UK earnings, whichever is the greater. <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM040000:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM040000</remotelink> has more information about tax relief given to pension contributions.</p><p>Pension savings are tested against the annual allowance differently depending on the type of arrangement. For other money purchase arrangements and hybrid arrangements that might provide other money purchase benefits, it is the actual amount of contributions that are tested. For other types of arrangements (e.g. defined benefits) it is the increase in the value of benefit rights that is tested not the amount of contributions.</p><p>If a member&#8217;s pension saving is more than the annual allowance they will pay a tax charge on the amount over the annual allowance.

A general &#8216;rule of thumb&#8217; for defined benefits arrangements is that large pay increases can create large pension input amounts, particularly when combined with long pensionable service. High pensionable pay and high accrual rates also result in higher pension savings. So all other conditions being equal, someone who builds up benefits at a rate of 1/50th per year of service will have a larger pension input than someone with a 1/60th accrual rate.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM053300:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM053300</remotelink> gives more information on how to work out the pension input amount for a defined benefits arrangement.</p><p>For cash balance arrangements the pension input amount is based on the increase in the individual&#8217;s promised pension pot over the pension input period.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM053400:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM053400</remotelink> gives more information on how to work out the pension input amount for a cash balance arrangement.</p><p>For a hybrid arrangement the possible types of benefit and their pension input amounts have to be identified.
