It is that all of the members of the “relevant group” were members of the group for which a return was submitted.</p><sup>8</sup><p>Condition B relates to a larger group, but one without an existing reporting company. It is that (a) the relevant group includes UK group companies that were</p><sup>9</sup><p>In neither case is there any impediment to the existing reporting company doing all that is necessary.</p><sup>10</sup><p>If the period of account is correctly identified, the closure notice will then direct the reporting company to submit a revised return for the period of account.</p><sup>11</sup><p>If the period of account in the original return was incorrect, the reporting company must be required by the closure notice to submit returns for each correct period of account, even if the composition of each relevant group is not the same in each period. The company is treated as having been appointed as reporting company for each of those groups - PARA49(10). Paras 49(12) and 50(2) require the returns to be submitted within 3 months of the issue of the closure notice, overriding any time limit that might otherwise apply.</p><sup>12</sup><p>The requirements of PARA50 apply to these returns, see CFM98800.</p><sup>13</sup><p>Where the reporting company fails to submit a return within the time limit, an officer of Revenue and Customs may make a determination under PARA58, see CFM98870.</p><sup>14</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>15</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
