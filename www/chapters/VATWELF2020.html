At the same time the condition that services must be provided otherwise than for profit was removed.</p><sup>4</sup><p>A further amendment was made in 2003, by Statutory Instrument 2003/24, which inserted the word agency to Item 9(b). This extended the exemption to state-regulated private welfare agencies such as domiciliary care agencies and fostering agencies. (See VATWELF2080 for further detail about state regulation).</p><sup>5</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>6</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
