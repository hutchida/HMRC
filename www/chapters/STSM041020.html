Under the provisions of section 99(5), ‘chargeable securities’ will not include securities the transfer of which is exempt from all stamp duty. Broadly speaking, if a transaction is exempt from stamp duty then it will also be exempt from SDRT. Securities which are exempt from stamp duties, such as gilts (FA99/SCH13/PARA24) and loan capital (FA86/S79), are exempt from SDRT.</p></div></div></body></html>
