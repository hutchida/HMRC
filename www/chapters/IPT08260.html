Where an insurer offers to produce records at a place other than the PPOB and you are satisfied that, for the purpose of the intended visit, this presents no obstacle to your audit objectives, you can agree although you should make it clear that your acceptance of the offer does not set a precedent. Write to the insurer explaining that it is an exceptional concession and that you reserve the right to visit the PPOB at all times. If you find, on a visit, that the PPOB is not as previously known or notified, obtain written confirmation of the change from the insurer and contact the BTOps (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT01200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">IPT01200</remotelink>) to change the details: <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT10125:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">IPT10125</remotelink>&#160;refers.
