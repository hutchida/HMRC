Write to the insurer explaining that it is an exceptional concession and that you reserve the right to visit the PPOB at all times. If you find, on a visit, that the PPOB is not as previously known or notified, obtain written confirmation of the change from the insurer and contact the BTOps (see IPT01200) to change the details: IPT10125 refers. Where business activities are spread over a number of locations, you may need to visit all the significant premises to make sure that your audit covers all the taxable activities of the registered insurer.
