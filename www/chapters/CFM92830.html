The interest meets the conditions to be disregarded under Chapter 5.

It is not a financing income amount under Para 55 that enters into the computation of the company&#8217;s net financing deduction or net financing income. The company therefore has, for Chapter 8 purposes, a financing expense amount of &#163;600,000 and a financing income amount of &#163;100,000, giving it a net financing deduction under TIOPA10/S329(2) of &#163;550,000.</p><h3>Example 2</h3><p>The facts are as in example 1, except that the company has no financing expense amounts. After the &#163;550,000 interest receivable from the EEA group company has been disregarded, it is therefore left with a financing income amount of &#163;100,000. This is below the de minimis limit of &#163;500,000 in TIOPA10/S331 (see CFM91240), so the company&#8217;s financing income amount is nil.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CFM92820:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CFM92840:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><h3>This guidance applies to worldwide group periods of account ending before or straddling 1 April 2017.</h3><h3>Interaction between TIOPA10/PT7/CH5, CH7 and CH8</h3><p>TIOPA10/PT7/CH5 is a self-contained provision with its own definition of &#8216;financing income amounts&#8217; (<remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_CFM92820:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CFM92820</remotelink>).
