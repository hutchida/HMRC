However, in order to counter fraud certain supplies were zero-rated from 31 July 2009. The zero rate was, in turn, replaced on 1 November 2010 by a reverse charge. For more on the zero-rate and reverse charge see VATSC64240.</p><sup>1</sup><p>For information about the earlier VAT treatment of cross-border supplies see Notice 741 (Place of supply of services (before 1 January 2010))</p><sup>2</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>3</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
