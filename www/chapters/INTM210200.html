In practice, determining whether they are in fact the same profits cannot be done without actually working out which of the assumed total profits arise under both Chapters 6 and 7 and which of the assumed total profits relate to UK business or support UK risks.</p><sup>19</sup><p>The following is a simple example of how the allocation of profits arising from UK and non-UK premiums could be determined. The allocation of profits arising from UK and non-UK premiums is likely to be more complicated than the straight line apportionment used in this example.

During the first year of trading the CFC receives premiums of £60m from UK group companies and £40m from non-UK group companies. It makes the following profits during the first year:</p><sup>22</sup><p>Underwriting profit of £20m, of which £12m relates to business written with the UK. This reflects the general proportion of business, 60%, written with the UK.</p><sup>23</sup><p>Investment profits of £15m, of which £10m relates to the initial capital and £3m relates to the investment of UK premiums.</p><sup>24</sup><p>Out of the assumed total profits of £35m, the profits of £21m generated from business written with the UK (£12m underwriting profit, £6m investment profit from the initial capital that supports the UK business and £3m from the investment of UK premiums) pass through the CFC charge gateway by way of chapter 7. All of the assets that the CFC invests in are free assets as the CFC has no loan capital. The group considers that 75% of the free assets are excess and so 75% of the profits generated from the free assets attributable to the initial capital (75% of £10m giving £7.5m) pass through the CFC charge gateway by way of Chapter 6.</p><sup>25</sup><p>So out of the £10m investment profits earned from the initial capital, £6m falls within Chapter 7 and £7.5m falls within Chapter 6. There is no way of establishing whether the excessive capital relates to capital supporting the UK business or the capital supporting the non-UK business. In such a case, the amount that potentially falls within both chapters is taken as £6m. And so the amount that passes through the charge gateway is £21m + £7.5m - £6m = £22.5m.</p><sup>26</sup><p>At the end of the first year, the underwriting profits are retained and invested. During the second year the CFC makes the following profits:</p><sup>27</sup><p>Underwriting profit of £25m, of which £15m relates to business written with the UK</p><sup>28</sup><p>Investment profits of £17m, of which £10m relates to the initial capital, £3.6m relates to the investment of UK premiums earned in year 2 and £0.6m relates to the investment of the retained profits earned from UK business in year 1 (60% of the retained profits come from UK business)</p><sup>29</sup><p>Out of the assumed total profits of £42m, the profits of £25.2m generated from business written with the UK (£15m underwriting profit, £6m investment profit from the initial capital that supports the UK business, £3.6m from the investment of the year 2 premiums and £0.6m from the investment of profits generated from UK business in year 1) pass through the CFC charge gateway by way of chapter 7. All of the assets that the CFC invests in are still free assets as the CFC has no loan capital. The group again considers that 75% of the free assets are excess and so 75% of the profits generated from the free assets attributable to the UK capital contributions (which is the initial capital of £200m), in total £7.5m, can pass through the gateway by way of Chapter 6.</p><sup>30</sup><p>However as with year 1, as £6m of the profits that fall within chapter 6 are part of the profits of £25.2m that fall within chapter 7, the £6m only passes through the CFC charge gateway once. And so the amount that passes through the charge gateway is £25.2m + £7.5m - £6m = £26.7m.</p><sup>31</sup><p>In conjunction with Chapter 7, the above rules prevent the use of UK financed captive insurance CFCs operating as “money boxes”.</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\INTM210200.xml</p><hr/><sup>0</sup><p>It will be unlikely that a captive insurance CFC will be able to benefit from the entity based CFC exemptions, with the possible exception of the Low Profits Exemption.
