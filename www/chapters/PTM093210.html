For the online application to be valid, certain conditions have to be met.&#160;These conditions are that the application must:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>be made by or on behalf of the individual concerned,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>contain the individual&#8217;s title, full name, full postal address and e-mail address and, where the individual is not the applicant, contain the same details for the applicant as well</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>give the individual&#8217;s date of birth</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>give the individual&#8217;s National Insurance number (or if they do not have a National Insurance number, give the reason for this),</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>contain a declaration that the member meets the conditions for FP 2016 (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM093210:MANUAL-PARA_APPLY:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">How to apply for FP </remotelink>2016 {#}<remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM093210:MANUAL-PARA_APPLY:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid"> - introduction</remotelink>),</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>contain a declaration that everything stated in the application is true and complete to the best of the applicant&#8217;s knowledge and belief,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>contain a declaration that the individual has met the conditions referred to in the introduction above, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>contain a declaration that, in the period from 6 April 2016 to the date the application is made, no protection-cessation event (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM093400:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM093400</remotelink>) has occurred in relation to the member.</p></li><p>There is no need to give any valuation of current or expected pension funds as part of the application.</p><h3>Giving up enhanced protection</h3><p>If a member has enhanced protection on 6 April 2016 then they cannot benefit from FP 2016.</p><p>Once a member has told HMRC that they plan to rely on enhanced protection they will have received a certificate with details of their protection. However, unlike primary protection a member can choose to give up enhanced protection.</p><p>If a member has enhanced protection only (without primary protection) then so long as they have given this up before 6 April 2016 they can apply for FP 2016.</p><p>If a member holds both primary and enhanced protection and they choose to give up enhanced protection, they will still have their primary protection. As a member cannot give up primary protection, this will stop them from benefitting from FP 2016.</p><p>If an individual wishes to give up enhanced protection they must tell HMRC in writing. The relevant legislation says that in such cases, enhanced protection ceases from the date HMRC receives this written notice. So enhanced protection cannot be given up from some future date. If a member wished to keep enhanced protection until 5 April 2016 they must have ensured that HMRC received their written notice on that date. Once an individual has given up enhanced protection they cannot change their mind. Enhanced protection cannot be re-instated. If a member gets FP 2016 by giving up enhanced protection and later finds they made the wrong decision they cannot get their enhanced protection back.</p><h3>Will HMRC accept all applications for FP 2016?</h3><p>Paragraphs 14(1), (2), (4), and 16 Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016</p><p>As long as the member completes the prescribed form giving all the information that is requested then the application is a valid application which will be accepted by&#160;HMRC. Where HMRC refuse to accept an application, they must notify the member who has a right to appeal against that decision (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM093210:MANUAL-PARA_APPEAL:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Appeal against HMRC&#8217;s refusal to issue or decision to withdraw a reference number</remotelink>).</p><h3>How will a member know if HMRC has accepted their application for FP 2016?</h3><p>Paragraph 14(1) to (4) Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016</p><p>When HMRC has received an application and accepted it as valid they will issue the member with a reference number unless the member already has IP 2014.&#160;This will be done online.</p><p>Where the member makes a valid application for FP 2016 but has already successfully applied for IP 2014, then their application is successful on a dormant basis.&#160;This is because IP 2014 protects pension savings&#160;with a value of&#160;between &#163;1.25 millions and&#160;&#163;1.5 million&#160;and so protects a greater amount of pension savings than FP 2016.&#160;This means that HMRC will not issue the member with a reference number unless and until the member&#8217;s IP 2014 no longer applies (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM094400:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM094400</remotelink> for&#160;when&#160;this happens).&#160;HMRC will notify the individual accordingly.&#160;If IP 2014 no longer applies, the member must inform HMRC of this whereupon HMRC will issue the FP 2016 reference number.</p><h3>When HMRC may withdraw a FP 2016 reference number</h3><p>Paragraph 15 Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016</p><p>HMRC may withdraw a reference number that they have issued to a member if</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>something contained in the member&#8217;s application was incorrect there has been a protection-cessation event (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM093400:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM093400 </remotelink>for more detail) since their application was made</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the member has failed to respond within the given deadline to a notice given by HMRC under paragraph 1 of Schedule 36 to Finance Act 2008 relating to the member and FP 2016.</p></li><p>If HMRC withdraws a member&#8217;s FP 2016 they must notify the member to tell them that they have done so and give their reasons for the withdrawal.

As a member cannot give up primary protection, this will stop them from benefitting from FP 2016.</p><p>If an individual wishes to give up enhanced protection they must tell HMRC in writing. The relevant legislation says that in such cases, enhanced protection ceases from the date HMRC receives this written notice. So enhanced protection cannot be given up from some future date. If a member wished to keep enhanced protection until 5 April 2016 they must have ensured that HMRC received their written notice on that date.

These are that, on 6 April 2016, they:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>were a member of a registered pension scheme or a relieved member of a relevant non-UK pension scheme (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM113410:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM113410</remotelink> for definitions of a &#8216;relieved member&#8217; and a &#8216;relieved non-UK pension scheme&#8217;),</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>did not have primary protection (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM092300:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM092300</remotelink> for more detail), did not have enhanced protection (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM092400:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM092400</remotelink> for more detail),</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>did not have FP 2012 or FP 2014 (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM093000:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM093000</remotelink> for more detail)</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>did not have individual protection 2014 (IP 2014) - see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM094000:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM094000</remotelink> for more detail.</p></li><p>Once a member is satisfied that they meet these conditions then they can apply to HMRC to get FP 2016 provided a protection-cessation event (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM093400:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM093400</remotelink>) has not occurred.</p><p>Once, an individual has FP 2016 there are restrictions on what they are able to do with their future pension savings. For example, they will normally have needed to stop building up benefits under every registered pension scheme that they belong to by 5 April 2016.</p><h3>Applications for FP 2016 must be made online</h3><p>Paragraph 14(3)(b) and (c) Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016</p><p>Applications for FP 2016 must be made online on or after 6 April 2016. See link below for more details.</p><p>https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pension-schemes-protect-your-lifetime-allowance</p><h3>Who can make an online applications for FP 2016?</h3><p>Paragraph 14(3)(a) Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016</p><p>An application can be made by either the member themselves or some other person on their behalf.</p><h3>Conditions required for a valid application for FP 2016</h3><p>Paragraph 14(3) Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016</p><p>An application for FP 2016 must be made online on or after 6 April 2016 (see above). For the online application to be valid, certain conditions have to be met.&#160;These conditions are that the application must:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>be made by or on behalf of the individual concerned,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>contain the individual&#8217;s title, full name, full postal address and e-mail address and, where the individual is not the applicant, contain the same details for the applicant as well</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>give the individual&#8217;s date of birth</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>give the individual&#8217;s National Insurance number (or if they do not have a National Insurance number, give the reason for this),</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>contain a declaration that the member meets the conditions for FP 2016 (see](#apply) 2016 {#} <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM093210:MANUAL-PARA_APPLY:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">- introduction</remotelink>),</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>contain a declaration that everything stated in the application is true and complete to the best of the applicant&#8217;s knowledge and belief,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>contain a declaration that the individual has met the conditions referred to in the introduction above, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>contain a declaration that, in the period from 6 April 2016 to the date the application is made, no protection-cessation event (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM093400:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM093400</remotelink>) has occurred in relation to the member.</p></li><p>There is no need to give any valuation of current or expected pension funds as part of the application.</p><h3>Giving up enhanced protection</h3><p>If a member has enhanced protection on 6 April 2016 then they cannot benefit from FP 2016.</p><p>Once a member has told HMRC that they plan to rely on enhanced protection they will have received a certificate with details of their protection. However, unlike primary protection a member can choose to give up enhanced protection.</p><p>If a member has enhanced protection only (without primary protection) then so long as they have given this up before 6 April 2016 they can apply for FP 2016.</p><p>If a member holds both primary and enhanced protection and they choose to give up enhanced protection, they will still have their primary protection. As a member cannot give up primary protection, this will stop them from benefitting from FP 2016.</p><p>If an individual wishes to give up enhanced protection they must tell HMRC in writing. The relevant legislation says that in such cases, enhanced protection ceases from the date HMRC receives this written notice. So enhanced protection cannot be given up from some future date. If a member wished to keep enhanced protection until 5 April 2016 they must have ensured that HMRC received their written notice on that date. Once an individual has given up enhanced protection they cannot change their mind. Enhanced protection cannot be re-instated. If a member gets FP 2016 by giving up enhanced protection and later finds they made the wrong decision they cannot get their enhanced protection back.</p><h3>Will HMRC accept all applications for FP 2016?</h3><p>Paragraphs 14(1), (2), (4), and 16 Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016</p><p>As long as the member completes the prescribed form giving all the information that is requested then the application is a valid application which will be accepted by&#160;HMRC. Where HMRC refuse to accept an application, they must notify the member who has a right to appeal against that decision (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM093210:MANUAL-PARA_APPEAL:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Appeal against HMRC&#8217;s refusal to issue or decision to withdraw a reference number</remotelink>).</p><h3>How will a member know if HMRC has accepted their application for FP 2016?</h3><p>Paragraph 14(1) to (4) Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016</p><p>When HMRC has received an application and accepted it as valid they will issue the member with a reference number unless the member already has IP 2014.&#160;This will be done online.</p><p>Where the member makes a valid application for FP 2016 but has already successfully applied for IP 2014, then their application is successful on a dormant basis.&#160;This is because IP 2014 protects pension savings&#160;with a value of&#160;between &#163;1.25 millions and&#160;&#163;1.5 million&#160;and so protects a greater amount of pension savings than FP 2016.&#160;This means that HMRC will not issue the member with a reference number unless and until the member&#8217;s IP 2014 no longer applies (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM094400:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM094400</remotelink> for&#160;when&#160;this happens).&#160;HMRC will notify the individual accordingly.&#160;If IP 2014 no longer applies, the member must inform HMRC of this whereupon HMRC will issue the FP 2016 reference number.</p><h3>When HMRC may withdraw a FP 2016 reference number</h3><p>Paragraph 15 Schedule 4 Finance Act 2016</p><p>HMRC may withdraw a reference number that they have issued to a member if</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>something contained in the member&#8217;s application was incorrect there has been a protection-cessation event (see](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/pensions-tax-manual/ptm093400) for more detail) since their application was made</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the member has failed to respond within the given deadline to a notice given by HMRC under paragraph 1 of Schedule 36 to Finance Act 2008 relating to the member and FP 2016.</p></li><p>If HMRC withdraws a member&#8217;s FP 2016 they must notify the member to tell them that they have done so and give their reasons for the withdrawal.
