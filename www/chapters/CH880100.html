Officers who suspect that an agent has been dishonest must not investigate the dishonest conduct themselves but must refer the suspected dishonest conduct to the ACT. See CH880400 for guidance on how to make a referral to the ACT.</p><sup>11</sup><p>Specialist officers within ACT will handle investigations into suspected dishonest conduct by tax agents. Guidance starting at CH881000 is for those specialist officers.</p><sup>12</sup><p>Specialist officers will establish whether there is dishonest conduct by engaging with agents and organisations, and they will issue conduct notices. They will work with organisations affected by dishonest conduct, getting access to files and using file access notices where necessary.</p><sup>13</sup><p>Non-compliance with file access notices can be penalised and there are sanctions for concealing documents.</p><sup>14</sup><p>There is a penalty for dishonest conduct of between £5,000 and £50,000. Where the penalty is more than £5,000 we can publish certain details about the dishonest tax agent. We can only charge a penalty under this legislation where the dishonest conduct occurred on or after 1 April 2013.</p><sup>15</sup><p>We can also refer details of dishonest tax agents to their professional bodies and, where they are not members of a professional body, to HMRC colleagues who register them under the Money Laundering Regulations.</p><sup>16</sup><p>This operational guidance supports and complements the technical guidance which starts at CH180000. In particular, it gives examples of what is dishonest conduct and the processes to establish dishonest conduct, get access to agent’s files, charge penalties, publish details and monitor dishonest tax agents.</p><sup>17</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
