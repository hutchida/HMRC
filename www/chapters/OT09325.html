The latter may be non-UK or non-ring fence companies. The costs of these support departments are usually allocated by a variety of means to various project AFEs (authorities for expenditure) or cost centres. Such means include &#8216;timewriting&#8217; where support staff record their time spent project by project and those times are each translated to a cost.

The onus is on the company to demonstrate that there is a direct relationship between the overhead expense and the field qualifying purpose. The view of LB Oil &amp; Gas is that this is not present where the costs in question relate to such activities as maintaining the company or preserving its corporate image. </p><h3>Disallowable costs</h3><p>Broadly speaking, the following costs should be identified and dealt with as remote or disallowable items (the list is not exhaustive and merely gives a flavour of the types of expenditure which LB Oil &amp; Gas considers generally to be disallowable):</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>long-term corporate planning </p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>policy</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>public and government relations</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>finance\\treasury</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>tax</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>advertising, donations, sponsorship </p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>entertaining</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>legal</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>intra-group relations.</p></li><p>But not all legal expenses will be disallowable.

The sum paid is usually allocated in the payer&#8217;s ledgers to various cost centres rather in the same way as its own overhead expenditure.
