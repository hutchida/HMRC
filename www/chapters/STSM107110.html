Rather than separately contributing cash directly to one or more unit trusts (or OEICS) in return for units issued by each fund, an investor can choose to invest in a range of funds by registering at one central on-line location with an entity commonly called a fund supermarket.</p><sup>1</sup><p>The role of a fund supermarket is to allow investors access to a wide range of unit trusts and OEICS which are offered on-line by the supermarket. Once registered, an investor places an on-line instruction with the operator of the supermarket (typically called, in generic terms, as the ‘intermediary’) to, say, purchase units in one or more unit trusts/OEICS to the value of total cash contributed by the investor. The supermarket operator contacts the underlying fund manager(s) to purchase the required units and OEIC shares. Units/OEIC shares purchased are held, (unlike a direct investment in each fund by the investor) in the legal name of the supermarket (or that of its nominee), as nominee for, and on behalf of, the investor.</p><sup>2</sup><p>Conversely, when an investor is no longer interested in holding an interest in units/OEIC shares held on his behalf by the supermarket, he can instruct the operator to surrender the units/OEIC shares to the relevant underlying trust fund or OEIC.</p><sup>3</sup><p>The benefits to an investor of using a supermarket include:</p><sup>4</sup><p>being able to pay a single amount on-line for interests arranged and acquired by the supermarket on the investors behalf in various unit trusts/OEICs;</p><sup>5</sup><p>receiving a single statement (from the supermarket) which outlines all of the investments purchased (or sold); and</p><sup>6</sup><p>lower costs, as many supermarkets are able to negotiate more favourable buying and selling unit/OEIC share prices with individual fund managers.</p><sup>7</sup><p>See STSM101020 for the meaning of a unit trust.</p><sup>8</sup><p>See STSM101050 for the meaning of an open-ended investment company.</p><sup>9</sup><p>See STSM101010 for the meaning of a collective investment scheme.</p><sup>10</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>11</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
