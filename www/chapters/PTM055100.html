There is a deemed annual allowance of £50,000 if the previous year included any of 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11. However, certain individuals might have deemed pension input amounts to take into account (see PTM055200 for details).</p><sup>46</sup><p>There are transitional annual allowance rules for tax year 2015-16 (see PTM058000 onwards).</p><sup>47</sup><p>For annual allowance purposes only, tax year 2015-16 is split into two ‘mini’ tax years:</p><sup>48</sup><p>the pre-alignment tax year (6 April 2015 to 8 July 2015), and</p><sup>49</sup><p>the post-alignment tax year (9 July 2015 to 5 April 2016).</p><sup>50</sup><p>If the previous tax year in question is the pre-alignment tax year, any unused annual allowance from that ‘mini’ tax year is capped at £40,000.</p><sup>51</sup><p>Despite the annual allowance for the pre-alignment tax year being £80,000, if the amount of unused annual allowance for that year exceeds £40,000, the maximum amount that can be carried forward is limited to £40,000.</p><sup>52</sup><p>If the previous tax year in question is the post-alignment tax year and the individual was a member of registered pension scheme at any time during the pre-alignment tax year then no unused annual allowance can be carried forward from the post-alignment tax year. This is because the individual has a nil annual allowance for that ‘mini’ tax year in this case.</p><sup>53</sup><p>If an individual was not a member of a registered pension scheme at any time during a previous tax year then the individual will not have unused annual allowance to carry forward from that year.</p><sup>54</sup><p>For most individuals being a member of a registered pension scheme at some point during a previous tax year will be the first requirement that must be met in order to determine how much unused annual allowance can then be carried forward from that year.</p><sup>55</sup><p>However some individuals might still be able to carry forward unused annual allowance from a previous tax year despite not being a member of a registered pension scheme at any time during that year. This would occur if, during the previous tax year, the individual was instead a member of a non-UK pension scheme in certain circumstances. PTM113300 has more details.</p><sup>56</sup><h4>Example 1</h4><sup>57</sup><p>An individual’s total pension input amount for the tax year 2014-15 is £25,000 and the annual allowance for the tax year is £40,000. The individual’s unused annual allowance for that tax year is £15,000 (£40,000 less £25,000).</p><sup>58</sup><h4>Example 2</h4><sup>59</sup><p>In the tax year 2012-13, an individual is a deferred member of a registered pension scheme but has no pension input amount for that year in respect of the deferred benefit rights because the ‘deferred member carve-out’ applies (see PTM053910). If they have no other pension input amount to take into account for that year, the individual would have unused annual allowance of £50,000 for that tax year.</p><sup>60</sup><h4>Example 3</h4><sup>61</sup><p>An individual joins a registered pension scheme for the first time on 1 June 2009 with a first pension input period of 1 June 2009 to 1 June 2010.

If so the unused allowance is the difference between the ‘other inputs’ and the alternative annual allowance.</p><sup>80</sup><p>For example, if the individual’s ‘other inputs’ for the tax year are £25,000 and the alternative annual allowance for the tax year is £30,000 then the unused allowance for the tax year is £5,000 (£30,000 less £25,000).</p><sup>81</sup><p>Note - a previous tax year for which an individual might have an annual allowance charge by reference to the money purchase annual allowance cannot be any earlier than 2015-16.</p><sup>82</sup><p>Note - tax year 2015-16 is split into two ‘mini’ tax years for annual allowance purposes (the pre and post-alignment tax years) and the amount of alternative annual allowance for either, or both, of the ‘mini’ tax years depends on the circumstances of the individual (PTM058030 has more details).</p><sup>83</sup><p>Note - if the previous tax year is 2016-17 (or a later tax year) and the tapered annual allowance applied as well for that year, the ‘other inputs’ are tested against the individual’s reduced alternative annual allowance.</p><sup>84</sup><p>Top of page</p><sup>85</sup><h4>The effect of carry forward</h4><sup>86</sup><p>If the individual’s total pension input amount for the tax year is less than their available annual allowance there will be no annual allowance tax charge for that tax year.</p><sup>87</sup><p>If an individual’s total pension input amount is more than their available annual allowance then they will be liable to the annual allowance charge on the amount over their available annual allowance.</p><sup>88</sup><p>For this purpose ‘available annual allowance’ means the annual allowance for the current tax year plus any unused annual allowance that can be carried forward to the current tax year from any of the previous (three or four) tax years. Whether unused annual allowance is carried forward from the previous three, or previous four, tax years depends on which tax year is the current tax year for carry forward purposes (see The carry forward rule – from which previous tax years above).</p><sup>89</sup><p>Tax year 2015-16 is split into two ‘mini’ tax years for annual allowance purposes, the pre and post-alignment tax years.</p><sup>90</sup><p>Where the current tax year is</p><sup>91</sup><p>the post-alignment tax year, and</p><sup>92</sup><p>the individual was a member of a registered pension scheme at any time during the pre-alignment tax year,</p><sup>93</sup><p>‘available annual allowance’ means only any unused annual allowance that can be carried forward to the current tax year from the previous four tax years (i.e. in this circumstance, there is a nil annual allowance for the post-alignment tax year to which any available unused annual allowance is added).</p><sup>94</sup><p>Where an individual has unused annual allowance from a previous tax year that they can use to set off against an annual allowance charge for a current tax year, they do not have to include this on their Self Assessment tax return for the year in which the unused allowance arose or for the year that the unused annual allowance is being used to set off against an annual allowance charge.</p><sup>95</sup><p>Individuals who are subject to the money purchase annual allowance for tax year 2015-16 (as split into two ‘mini’ tax years), or later tax years, might still be liable to an annual allowance charge that must be included in their Self Assessment tax return despite their total pension input amount not exceeding their available annual allowance. This would be the case where the only amount subject to the annual allowance charge is in respect of a ‘money-purchase’ input in excess of the money purchase annual allowance.</p><sup>96</sup><p>Note - when the money purchase annual allowance applies for a current tax year, any unused annual allowance from a previous tax year cannot be added to it. Any unused annual allowance can be added only to the alternative annual allowance.</p><sup>97</sup><h4>Example 6</h4><sup>98</sup><p>Raj is a self-employed plumber.

Because of her large pay rise and because this means that her pension is based on this pay for all of her years of service, Rose’s pension saving for the 2012-13 tax year is £55,000. This is more than the £50,000 annual allowance for 2012-13.</p><sup>109</sup><p>As Rose has not used all her annual allowance in the last three tax years she can carry forward her unused annual allowance.

For the previous three tax years before 2011-12, as well as the unused annual allowance of £10,000 for 2010-11, there is also unused annual allowance of £5,000 for each of 2009-10 and 2008-09. This means there is still available unused annual allowance from 2010-11 that can be carried forward to 2013-14 - in this example £5,000 worth can be carried forward. This is despite the unused annual allowance for 2010-11 being less than the excess for 2011-12.</p><sup>183</sup><p>However, the position for the tax years 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11 (where a deemed annual allowance of £50,000 applies for this purpose) is different when the pension input amount is more than £50,000 in 2009-10 and/or 2010-11 and there is available annual allowance from a preceding year(s). PTM055300 has more details.</p><sup>184</sup><h4>Example 10</h4><sup>185</sup><p>Sam’s total pension input amount for 2014-15 is £42,000. This is £2,000 more than the annual allowance of £40,000. Sam will have an annual allowance charge on £2,000 if she has no available annual allowance to carry forward from the previous three tax years. Her total pension input amounts for those years are:</p><sup>186</sup><p>2013-14 - £54,000 2012-13 - £44,000 2011-12 - £49,000</p><sup>187</sup><p>The annual allowance for each of those years was £50,000 and remains so for carry forward purposes, despite the annual allowance for the current tax year being £40,000.</p><sup>188</sup><p>Sam has £1,000 unused annual allowance from 2011-12 and £6,000 from 2012-13. Sam’s total pension input amount for 2013-14 is more than the annual allowance so she has no available annual allowance to carry forward from that year.</p><sup>189</sup><p>Sam can only carry forward unused annual allowance if it has not been used up by a total pension input amount that is more than the annual allowance in a later tax year.</p><sup>190</sup><p>As Sam’s total pension input amount for 2013-14 is more than the annual allowance of £50,000 for that tax year this might have a bearing on the amount of unused annual allowance she can carry forward to 2014-15 from 2011-12 and/or 2012-13. This will depend on what available annual allowance was used up on Sam’s total pension input amount of £54,000 for 2013-14.</p><sup>191</sup><p>In the previous three tax years before 2013-14 Sam’s total pension input amounts were:</p><sup>192</sup><p>2012-13 - £44,000 2011-12 - £49,000 2010-11 - £48,000</p><sup>193</sup><p>The £4,000 pension input amount that is more than the 2013-14 annual allowance will use up Sam’s available annual allowance from earlier years as follows:</p><sup>194</sup><p>2010-11 - £2,000 2011-12 - £1,000 2012-13 - £1,000</p><sup>195</sup><p>Sam has £5,000 available annual allowance to carry forward to 2014-15. So, in 2014-15 Sam can have a total pension input amount of £45,000 before she has to pay an annual allowance charge. Sam’s actual pension input amount of £42,000 is less than this so she has no annual allowance charge for 2014-15. She also has £3,000 annual allowance available from 2012-13 to carry forward to the pre-alignment tax year (tax year 2015-16 being split into two ‘mini’ tax years for annual allowance purposes, the pre and post-alignment tax years).</p><sup>196</sup><p>Note - if Sam’s total pension input amount for 2010-11 was £50,000 or more (or if Sam was not a member of a registered pension scheme or a non-UK pension scheme, in certain circumstances, at any time during 2010-11) then Sam would have £3,000 available annual allowance to carry forward to 2014-15. So Sam could have a total pension input amount of £43,000 before she has to pay an annual allowance charge and, based on her actual total pension input amount of £42,000 for 2014-15, Sam would have £1,000 annual allowance available from 2012-13 to carry forward to the pre-alignment tax year.</p><sup>197</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
