Unlike tax representatives, agents will not be liable for any tax due after 21 July 2008 and in most cases the overseas insurer will be solely responsible for paying IPT. However in some circumstances where an overseas insurer fails to account for IPT we can require the customer to account for the tax, although the conditions for using that requirement were also changed in the Budget 2008; see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT09300:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">IPT09300</remotelink>&#160;for further details.<nl /></p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT06310:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>This part of the guidance provides information on the revised procedures for registering overseas insurers for IPT and also provides information for existing representatives of overseas insurers.
