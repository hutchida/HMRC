A general provision is not allowable. Any provision against partial or complete irrecoverability must represent an estimate specific to the loan relationship and to the circumstances of the debtor.</p><p>Unpaid interest is a money debt due from the debtor company to the creditor company. It is not a loan relationship because there has been no lending of money in respect of this debt. It is, however, an &#8216;amount payable under a loan relationship&#8217; and therefore comes into Para 5.
