In the example above the insurer cannot treat 1 October 1999 as the date the premium is received (and it follows that this is not the insurer&#8217;s effective date of registration) because of the provisions of Regulation 23(1) which deals with premiums treated as received on the premium written date.

Therefore the premium may not be treated as received by the insurer on the premium written date and the insurer must account for tax on the date of actual receipt of the premium (1 April 2000) which will also be their effective date of registration.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT06240:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT06250:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>Insurers are required to notify the Department of their need to register within 30 days of forming an intention to receive taxable premiums.
