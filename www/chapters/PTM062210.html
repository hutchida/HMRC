If the scheme documentation states that the consent of the trustees or employer is required to take benefits the member does not have an unqualified right to take benefits. (It does not matter that the trustees have always operated their discretion to allow the payment of early benefits, the right is still not an unqualified right.)</p><p>For example, on 10 December 2003 a scheme may give its members an unqualified right to take pension benefits before age 55, but only if they are active members. Deferred members may take benefits before age 55 but only with the consent of the trustees or the employer. The active members as at 5 April 2006 who were also active members on 10 December 2003 or who joined the scheme after that date therefore have a protected pension age but the deferred members do not. On or after 6 April 2006, the employer decides that it will close its defined benefits section in the scheme and instead in future will provide benefits on a defined contributions basis in a new section of the existing scheme. As a result those members who were active members of the defined benefits section on 5 April 2006 become deferred members of that section and active members of the defined contributions section (with a reserved right, qualified or unqualified) to take benefits before age 55. However, these members still retain their protected pension age as this is unaffected by any changes in scheme rules made from 6 April 2006 onwards. So they are still able to take their benefits before age 55 after 2010 provided that consent to taking the deferred benefits (and their defined contribution section benefits if the right to them is qualified) is given and that they become entitled to all their scheme benefits under both the defined benefits and defined contributions sections on the same date.</p><p>Similarly on 10 December 2003 a scheme may not allow active members to take benefits early without trustee and/or employer consent but give deferred members an unqualified right to early payment of benefits from age 50. If an individual leaves pensionable service and becomes a deferred member in accordance with the scheme rules and exercises their right to take benefits before age 55 they will have a protected pension age. No protection will be given to those who are not deferred members, as they have not met the condition that allows them an unqualified right to take benefits.</p><p>Some rules give members an unqualified right to take benefits but only when a certain contingency occurs. It is only when the contingency occurs that the rules of the registered pension scheme give a member the unqualified right to take benefits before age 55 and that they will have a protected pension age. So unless and until the relevant contingency actually occurs in respect of them, the members do not have a protected pension age.</p><p>For example, on 10 December 2003 a scheme may give its members an unqualified right to take pension benefits before 55, but only if they are made redundant. If any members are made redundant after 5 April 2010, are aged over 50 but under 55 and exercise their right to take pension benefits, they will have a protected pension age and will not be liable to a tax charge.</p><p>Where members of an occupational or a public service pension scheme have a protected pension age of less than 50 then they may have a reduction in their lifetime allowance.
