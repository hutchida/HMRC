This view was challenged by some agencies.</p><sup>1</sup><p>We now accept that a welfare provider is not state-regulated until its registration has been approved by the relevant national regulator of care. Accordingly, a welfare provider is not state-regulated for the purposes of the VAT exemption, and therefore may not exempt welfare services, during the period of time in which its application to register is being considered.</p><sup>2</sup><p> Previous page</p></div></body></html>
