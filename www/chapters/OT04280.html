Its purpose is to prevent the possibility that unlimited carry back of losses could generate repayments which, together with interest thereon, exceed the expenditure incurred (after taking the consequential CT effects into account).</p><sup>2</sup><p>The intention of the legislation was that where any repayment or part of any repayment arises as a result of the carry back of a loss from a chargeable period ending after 30 June 1991 the total of the repayment and the interest arising thereon would be limited to the difference between 85% of the loss carried back and the amount of the repayment attributable to that loss (i.e. the interest is ‘capped’).</p><sup>3</sup><p>When the rate of charge of PRT was reduced by FA93 from 75% to 50% (see OT03525) the ‘cap’ was reduced from 85% to 60%. This applies to repayments in respect of chargeable periods ending after 30 June 1993 i.e. after the rate cut. Where losses are carried back to periods for which the rate of the PRT charge was 75%, the 85% cap continues to apply to the repayments for those periods.

The High Court found in favour of the Revenue that, where a loss in a later period is to be relieved against the profits of two earlier periods, the cap is to be applied in relation to each period on the basis that the “allowable loss” in OTA75\SCH2\PARA17(4)(a) is only that part of the loss treated as reducing the assessable profits of the particular earlier period.</p><sup>9</sup><p>Where a PRT repayment follows a series of PRT payments, for the purpose of identifying the date the PRT being repaid was paid the series of payments should be dealt with on a first in first out basis.</p><sup>10</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>11</sup><p> Next page</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\OT04280.xml</p><hr/><sup>title</sup><h3>Payment Provisions - Interest Cap</h3><sup>0</sup><h4>OTA75\SCH2\PARA17</h4><sup>1</sup><p>OTA75\SCH2\PARA17 was introduced by FA90\S121 as one of a number of measures concerned with relief for abandonment and provides for a limit on the amount of interest payable on certain repayments of PRT.
