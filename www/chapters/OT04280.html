This applies to repayments in respect of chargeable periods ending after 30 June 1993 i.e. after the rate cut. Where losses are carried back to periods for which the rate of the PRT charge was 75%, the 85% cap continues to apply to the repayments for those periods.

The High Court found in favour of the Revenue that, where a loss in a later period is to be relieved against the profits of two earlier periods, the cap is to be applied in relation to each period on the basis that the &#8220;allowable loss&#8221; in OTA75\\SCH2\\PARA17(4)(a) is only that part of the loss treated as reducing the assessable profits of the particular earlier period.</p><p>Where a PRT repayment follows a series of PRT payments, for the purpose of identifying the date the PRT being repaid was paid the series of payments should be dealt with on a first in first out basis.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT04270:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT04300:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><h3>OTA75\\SCH2\\PARA17</h3><p>OTA75\\SCH2\\PARA17 was introduced by FA90\\S121 as one of a number of measures concerned with relief for abandonment and provides for a limit on the amount of interest payable on certain repayments of PRT.
