The separately recognised host contract is treated as an independent loan relationship by S415, while the embedded derivative is treated as a relevant contract (which may or may not qualify as a derivative contract) by S585.</p><p>Where a company has issued, or holds, debt to which CTA09/S415 applies, only debits relating to the loan relationship element are taken into account when applying TIOPA10/S313(2). However, where debt contains an embedded derivative that is closely related to the host contract, and is therefore not accounted for separately, the financing expense amount will be computed by reference to the debt as a whole.</p><h3>Example 1</h3><p>A UK company issues a security where the redemption amount is linked to the FTSE 100 index.

Debits or credits may be brought into account under the derivative contracts rules; or, if the contract is an &#8216;exactly tracking contract&#8217; a chargeable gain or allowable loss is brought into account under CTA09/S658 when the financial liability comes to an end. In neither case, however, will these amounts be included in financing expense amounts under section 313(2), or in financing income amounts under section 314(2). Amounts are only &#8216;brought into account in respect of a loan relationship&#8217; for these purposes where they relate to the host contract - the separate loan relationship created by CTA09/S415.</p><h3>Example 2</h3><p>A company has borrowed money at a variable rate of interest, but under the loan agreement the interest rate is capped at 6.5%. When the loan is first taken out, the company is paying interest at 5.25%.</p><p>The loan contains an embedded derivative (a cap), but this is closely linked to the debt, and is above the commercial rate of interest when the loan is taken out.
