In some circumstances the decision was taken not to grant a concessionary period, such as for the rate rise announced in the June 2010 Budget.</p><p>When a concessionary period was not granted, the new rate of tax applied to taxable premiums with tax points under the special accounting scheme that fell on or after the implementation date of the rate increase, regardless of the inception (beginning or starting) date of the contract.</p><p>When a concessionary period was granted, the old rate of tax applied to taxable premiums for contracts incepting before the implementation date of a rate change that were written on or after that date, provided the tax point for those premiums occurred before the end of the transitional period.</p><p>The relevant dates for each rate change (Budget date, implementation date and concessionary date (if applicable)) are given in IPT07860</p><p>The new rate of tax would apply to all taxable premiums for contracts incepting on or after the implementation of a rate change.

See <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_IPT07810:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">IPT07810</remotelink> for the key determinants of whether the new rate applies after 1 June 2017.</p><p>The key factor in deciding whether the new rate applies to a premium is by reference to when the policy incepts (when cover for risk begins), rather than according to the tax accounting scheme or a concessionary period.&#160;This rule is subject to a &#8220;back-stop&#8221; provision which means that any premium received on or after the first anniversary of a rate rise is taxed at the new rate, regardless of when the policy incepted.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_IPT07810:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_IPT07820:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div></div></body></html>
