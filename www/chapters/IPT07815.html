See IPT07810 for the key determinants of whether the new rate applies after 1 June 2017.</p><sup>8</sup><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">The key factor in deciding whether the new rate applies to a premium is by reference to when the policy incepts (when cover for risk begins), rather than according to the tax accounting scheme or a concessionary period. This rule is subject to a “back-stop” provision which means that any premium received on or after the first anniversary of a rate rise is taxed at the new rate, regardless of when the policy incepted.</p><sup>9</sup><p style="background-color: #FFFF00"> Previous page</p><sup>10</sup><p style="background-color: #FFFF00"> Next page</p><sup>11</sup><sup>12</sup><sup>13</sup><sup>14</sup><sup>15</sup><sup>16</sup><sup>17</sup><sup>18</sup><sup>19</sup><sup>20</sup></div></div></body></html>
