As a result, many charities will undertake more commercially driven activities through a subsidiary company which it funds with an interest-bearing loan.</p><sup>3</sup><p>The charity will bring the interest into account when calculating its profit, which will then be exempted from tax where the income is applied for a charitable purpose. The interest will therefore not be a tax-interest income amount where this exemption applies. By contrast, the subsidiary company will be charged to corporation tax on its profits and will claim a deduction for the interest it pays to the charity, which would ordinarily be included in tax-interest expense.</p><sup>4</sup><p>This would result in tax asymmetry with debits in the company not matched with credits in the charity. This would lead to an increased net tax-interest expense for the group as a whole and a reduction in interest capacity.</p><sup>5</sup><h4>Exclusion where payment would qualify for Gift Aid</h4><sup>6</sup><p>Paying interest to the charity is a means of the subsidiary returning profits to that charity. The subsidiary would also have the option of making a Gift Aid donation, provided the relevant conditions at CTA10/S191 - S202 are met. This means there is no tax advantage to be gained from choosing to fund a subsidiary by debt because, absent a loan, the subsidiary could simply make a charitable donation to its charity parent equal to its profits and claim relief for this amount.</p><sup>7</sup><p>The rules therefore do not treat interest paid by a company on a loan as being a tax-interest expense amount of the company where:</p><sup>8</sup><p>The creditor is a charity</p><sup>9</sup><p>The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of that charity, and</p><sup>10</sup><p>Any donation made by the company to the charity would attract Gift Aid.</p><sup>11</sup><p>These tests do not concern themselves with whether a gift could legally be made and just look at whether such a gift would qualify for a charitable deduction if it were to be made.</p></div></body></html>
