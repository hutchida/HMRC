Where the widened second condition applied to an accounting period in which a dividend was paid, and the immediately preceding period ended on or before 28 November 1995, the widened second condition was treated as applying to that preceding accounting period also for the purposes of the requirement in ICTA88/S246S (9).</p><p>This second condition was set by ICTA88/S246S (3), ICTA88/S246S (4), ICTA88/S246S (8) and ICTA88/S246S (10A).</p><h3>Third condition</h3><p>The third condition was that at all times in the accounting period:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>each shareholder of the company owned at least 5% of the company&#8217;s share capital, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>at least 80% of the company&#8217;s share capital was owned by:</p></li><p>(a) persons who were not companies and who were not UK resident at any time in the accounting period or</p><p>(b) companies which were foreign held companies (CTM21530) in the accounting period, or</p><p>(c) persons falling within (a) above and companies falling within (b) above.</p><p>A company was an IHC if this third and the following fourth conditions were met.</p><p>The third condition was set by ICTA88/S246S (5) and ICTA88/S246S (6).</p><h3>Fourth condition</h3><p>The fourth condition was that:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>at all times in the accounting period not more than 20% of the company&#8217;s ordinary share capital was ultimately owned by persons who were not companies and were UK resident.</p></li><p>Where any shares were directly owned by a company their ultimate ownership was found by tracing ownership through corporate holders to persons who were not companies on such basis as was reasonable.</p><p>A company was an IHC if this and either the first or third conditions were met.</p><p>The fourth condition was set by ICTA88/S246S (7).</p><p></p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><h3>ICTA88/S246S (1)</h3><p>A company was an IHC if certain conditions were met.
