This rule captures both the underwriting and investment profits arising from the receipt and investment of insurance premiums derived (directly or indirectly) from contracts of insurance the CFC writes with:</p><sup>1</sup><p>UK resident connected companies, or</p><sup>2</sup><p>A UK permanent establishment (PE) of a connected non UK resident company, or</p><sup>3</sup><p>UK resident persons (subject to certain conditions).</p><sup>4</sup><p>Profits pass through the CFC charge gateway at Chapter 7 to the extent they are within a CFC’s assumed total profits and arise from:</p><sup>5</sup><p>the CFC’s “insurance business” (see INTM248100),</p><sup>6</sup><p>from contracts of insurance falling within TIOPA10/S371GA(2), and</p><sup>7</sup><p>for a CFC resident in an EEA state (to the extent the amount included is not from the activities of a PE of the CFC in a non-EEA state), from contracts of insurance where the insured (or original insured person for reinsurance contracts) has no significant UK non-tax reason for entering into that contract (see INTM210800).</p><sup>8</sup><p>It is important to note that a captive insurance CFC’s profits arising from contracts of insurance with non-UK resident companies (whether connected or not and provided not acting through a UK PE) and/or non-UK resident persons will not pass through the CFC charge gateway under Chapter 7. However this is subject to confirming, when dealing with a contract of reinsurance, that the underlying contract of insurance is not with a UK resident person.</p><sup>9</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>10</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
