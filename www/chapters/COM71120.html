The general principles are then as follows.</p><sup>5</sup><p>Leave undisturbed any assessments, including self assessments, and late filing penalty determinations already made. Do not make any new ones.</p><sup>6</sup><p>Leave in place any payments recorded on the COTAX record against assessments, interest charged, and penalty determinations.</p><sup>7</sup><p>Informally discharge any unpaid liabilities using function RINF (Record Informal Discharge).</p><sup>8</sup><p>Reallocate any overpayment from COTAX to the settlement charge using function REOD (Direct Reallocation Out of COTAX).</p><sup>9</sup><p>If an overpayment recorded on COTAX exceeds the amount you need to reallocate to cover the contract settlement charge:</p><sup>10</sup><p>reallocate the necessary amount using function REOD (Direct Reallocation Out Of COTAX)</p><sup>11</sup><p>use function REWD (Direct Reallocation Within COTAX) to reallocate the balance against other liabilities</p><sup>12</sup><p>if there are no such liabilities, repay the balance to the company using function DIRR (Direct Repayment).</p><sup>13</sup><p>After you have made those changes, you need to record on COTAX that the enquiry has been concluded.</p><sup>14</sup><p>Use function MAPS (Maintain AP Signals) to enter the enquiry ended date equal to the date that the settlement offer is accepted. That automatically sets the ‘enquiry in progress’ signal to ‘N’. You can view the changes to those signals in function DAPD (Display AP Details).</p><sup>15</sup><p>See:</p><sup>16</sup><p>the Action Guide at COM71120 for the detailed procedures to follow</p><sup>17</sup><p>COM71021 for a list of forms relevant to this subject</p><sup>18</sup><p>COM71011 for a list of functions to use in particular situations</p><sup>19</sup><p>COM71012 for legislation applying to this subject.</p><sup>20</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>21</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
