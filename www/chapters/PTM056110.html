There is an excess amount of &#163;30,000 on which she has to pay the annual allowance charge. Frances also has &#163;140,000 income that she has to pay tax on (her &#8216;reduced net income&#8217;) for the same tax year. Frances&#8217;s excess pension saving and reduced net income added together is &#163;170,000.</p><p>For the purpose of this example Frances&#8217;s higher rate limit is &#163;150,000 and her basic rate limit is &#163;40,000.</p><p>Step 1: Frances has &#163;140,000 income that she has to pay tax on (her &#8216;reduced net income&#8217;). Step 2: Frances has &#163;30,000 pension saving on which she has to pay the annual allowance charge. Step3: Frances&#8217;s excess pension saving and reduced net income added together is &#163;170,000. Step 4: The total after Step 3 exceeds &#163;150,000 by &#163;20,000 so &#163;20,000 of her excess pension savings is chargeable at 45 per cent. Step 5: The amount of Frances&#8217;s excess pension savings not chargeable at Step 4 is &#163;30,000 - &#163;20,000 = &#163;10,000. Step 6: The difference between Frances&#8217;s higher and basic rate limits is &#163;150,000 - &#163;40,000 = &#163;110,000. Step 7: The amount after Step 5 (&#163;10,000) is less than the amount after Step 6 (&#163;110,000) so &#163;10,000 is chargeable at 40 per cent.
