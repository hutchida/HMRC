This eases the administrative burden of the tax. Lloyd&#8217;s have, through regulatory powers under the Lloyd&#8217;s Act 1982, made this option compulsory for all syndicates that write non-motor business. Lloyd&#8217;s take the figures reported through the Lloyd&#8217;s Policy Signing Office (LPSO) and report them on the consolidated return.

Lloyd&#8217;s also provide the detailed information that supports the consolidated return and schedule.

You should follow normal audit assurance procedures for these syndicates. Many motor syndicates also write a small amount of non-motor business, which is processed through LPSO. There is a potential risk that the IPT relating to this business is omitted from the syndicate&#8217;s return.
