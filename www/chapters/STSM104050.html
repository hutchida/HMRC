This may include instances where an investor has exercised statutory cancellation rights, or where a deal is not completed as a result of a failed debit, or where a deal must be altered to correct an error.</p><sup>1</sup><p>In this situation, and for the purposes of Paragraph 4 of FA99/SCH19, HM Revenue &amp; Customs is content for unit trust managers and Authorised Corporate Directors of OEICs to adopt either of the following methods of accounting for cancelled/altered deals, as follows:-</p><sup>2</sup><p>(a) cancelled and altered deals may be included as amendments to issues and surrenders - whichever is applicable - in the charging period and relevant two-week period in which they occur, provided this is done on a consistent basis;</p><sup>3</sup><p>(b) alternatively, a full re-computation can be carried out, again provided this is done on a consistent basis.</p><sup>4</sup><p>The internal systems operated by some funds employ a third method whereby a cancelled issue or surrender is reported by inputting a contra transaction to reverse the trade. For example, a cancelled issue is reversed by the input of a surrender in a later period. This method is also acceptable to HMRC.</p><sup>5</sup><p>Difficulties can arise, however, where a fund accounts for cancelled or altered deals in accordance with option a) above which may result in a negative figure for issues and/or surrenders. The application of the reducing fraction ‘I/S’ (i.e. where the number of surrendered units/OEIC shares for the relevant two-week period exceeds the total number of issues in the same period) may, as a consequence, sometimes result in a negative “SDRT due” amount. In this situation, fund managers are required to apply the following procedures:-</p><sup>6</sup><p>(i) where, by including cancelled and altered deals in the period in which they occur, a cumulative negative figure representing issues or surrenders in the charging period and relevant two-week period results, the cumulative net negative figure should be treated as zero;</p><sup>7</sup><p>(ii) excess cancelled/altered issues over the actual number of issues in the charging period are to be carried forward and offset against the number of actual issues in the next charging period;</p><sup>8</sup><p>(iii) similarly, where a cumulative positive figure of surrenders in the charging period and relevant two-week period results, but the value of surrenders in the charging period itself is negative, the negative value should be treated as nil for the purposes of the SDRT calculation;</p><sup>9</sup><p>(iv) excess cancelled/altered surrenders over the actual number of surrenders in the charging period are to be carried forward and offset against the number of actual surrenders in the next charging period;</p><sup>10</sup><p>As an alternative, a fund may, of course, still choose option (b) and carry out a full re-computation - provided this is done on a consistent basis.</p><sup>11</sup><p>Where option (a) is chosen, it will therefore be necessary for monthly notices (under Regulation 4B Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax Regulations 1986 (SI 1986/1711 ) to include additional information to show the net cumulative quantity of excess issues or surrenders brought and carried forward.</p><sup>12</sup><p>Annex B and Annex C (STSM104100 and STSM104110) provide examples of notices involving net negative excess calculations. Both assume that all fund assets are non-exempt investments with no pro-rata or non-pro rata in specie redemptions or exempt third party declarations.</p><sup>13</sup><p>See STSM101020 for the meaning of a unit trust.</p><sup>14</sup><p>See STSM101050 for the meaning of an open-ended investment company.</p><sup>15</sup><p>See STSM104020 for reduction of SDRT charge where surrenders exceed issues.</p><sup>16</sup><p>See STSM103070 for the meaning of a ‘relevant two-week period’.</p><sup>17</sup><p>See STSM105100 for the meaning of in specie redemptions.</p><sup>18</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>19</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
