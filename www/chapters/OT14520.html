So in the case of a contract where there has been a front-loaded payment, even if the payer can demonstrate that an unconditional obligation has been met in that payment, only partial relief at most is likely to be available.

Generally LB Oil &amp; Gas accepts that the wording in FA93\\S191(1)(2) is a close replication of accounting practice and GAAP and we do not expect there to be a conflict in many cases. LB Oil &amp; Gas allows reasonably calculated accruals and stage payments under long term contracts where work relevant to the particular stage has been completed and the parties have fulfilled their obligations.
