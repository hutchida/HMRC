This involved a contract which had an original term of 20 years. The contract was amended by agreement between the parties, in particular changes were made to the price, the quantities of gas to be sold, and the term of the contract was extended from 20 years to 30 years.

The 2002 agreement did not answer to the statutory description: it was an agreement freely negotiated in 2002 to a purchaser, British Gas, who was one of a number of possible purchasers at what was a market price negotiated at a time when the impact of the tax was known.
