Typically we may want them during an enquiry (<remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_TSEM2160:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">TSEM2160</remotelink>), or when the status of the trust is in question.&#160;Deeds should be retained in Caseflow or&#160;the Digital Mail Service.</p><p>Occasionally you may receive a deed that you have not requested, it will be retained in the Digital Mail Service, and can be used in any future enquiry.&#160;Taxpayers and agents should be aware that the submission of documents may not provide protection against a discovery assessment beyond that arising from the submission of the return alone.&#160;The information contained in additional material may have been fully covered within the return, or, alternatively there may be so much material that the HMRC officer &#8216;could not have been reasonably expected, on the basis of the information made available to them before that time, to be aware&#8217; (TMA70/S29(5)) of the particular point of liability, unless the taxpayer or agent had explained its relevance (see EM3261).</p><h3>Copies or originals</h3><p>FA2008 Schedule 36, section 8(1) allows us to accept copies of documents.&#160;You should normally accept copy trust deeds.</p><p>You should not routinely ask to see the original trust deed if you have been supplied with a copy.&#160;However, it may be appropriate to request the original document, for example, where detail on the copy is unclear, incomplete, or there is doubt about its authenticity.</p><p>If you do need to access the original document, you can make a written request to see it.&#160;There is guidance on requesting original documents at <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_CH229900:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CH229900</remotelink>.</p><h3>Commenting on a trust deed</h3><p>It is not HMRC policy to advise on the interpretation of trust deeds.&#160;It is the trustee&#8217;s responsibility to interpret the terms of the trust, complete the tax return and self-assess accordinlgy.&#160;If they are in doubt then their accountant or solicitor should be able to help.&#160;</p><p>Decline any request to comment on a trust deed.&#160;Explain that it is not HMRC policy.</p><p>HMRC&#8217;s &#8216;Clearance and approvals&#160;guidance&#8217; states that :</p><p>&#8220;HMRC will not give clearances&#160;or advice for the&#160;application of the &#8216;settlements legislation&#8217; in Chaper 5 Part 5 Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act&#160;2005 or the tax consequences of executing non-charitable trust deeds or settlements.&#8221;</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_TSEM1710:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div></div></body></html>
