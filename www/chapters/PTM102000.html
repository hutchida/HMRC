It simply denotes that the scheme manager has notified HMRC that the scheme meets the conditions to be a recognised overseas pension scheme (ROPS) and has complied with certain information requirements. Similarly appearance on the published list of schemes that have told HMRC that they meet the conditions to be a ROPS is not a guarantee that the scheme is or will remain a QROPS.</p><p>If the scheme does not meet the conditions to be a ROPS when the transfer is made the transfer will not be a recognised transfer. The transfer will be an unauthorised payment and the member liable to tax of at least 40% of the value of the transfer payment. <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM134000:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM134000</remotelink> provides full guidance on the tax charges due on an unauthorised payment.</p><h3>The transfer may cause loss of protection</h3><p>Members need to consider the impact a transfer will have on any lifetime allowance, lump sum or pension age protection. The protection may be lost or the level of protection reduced because of a transfer.
