But, where an officer makes a determination under PARA58, this is intended to achieve finality, where a group has neither appealed a closure notice nor taken the steps required by the closure notice - PARA49(2)(b). Accordingly there is no further opportunity to submit returns.</p><sup>6</sup><p>PARA59 permits an appeal to be made against a PARA 58 determination within 30 days, but the scope of such an appeal is restricted to the question of whether the determination complies with the closure notice.</p><sup>7</sup><p>Where a notice of determination is given under PARA58 a company is treated as having amended its return in accordance with the determination - PARA 70(2).</p><sup>8</sup><p>It is possible that a determination might be made under PARA56 following the closure of an enquiry, but this would be the case only where a reporting company is appointed under PARA 51 or 53. This reporting company will then have 3 months to submit a return PARA7(5)(b) (or exceptionally until 12 months after the period of account were this later). The determination would then be part of the process applicable in the absence of a return, or one that meets the requirements of PARA20, see CFM98430.</p><sup>9</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>10</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
