Consider the case where a company transfers a freehold interest in a property to a member in circumstances where the property is subject to a tenancy held by the member. The market value of the tenancy should be taken into account when valuing the freehold interest. In contrast, however, consider the situation where a company grants a lease on a freehold property to a member at market value and then sells the encumbered freehold interest to the member at market value. As a result of these two transactions the member will hold the unencumbered freehold interest but the value of unencumbered freehold will exceed the sum of the market values of the leasehold interest and the encumbered freehold interest. In those circumstances the value of the distribution is based on the market value of the unencumbered freehold interest.</p><sup>31</sup><p>Another company may grant a member an option to buy an asset, such as a house. The price for the house is set when the company grants the option. When the member exercises the option the price the member pays for the company’s asset may be less than the current open market value. It may be contended that the member has given the value of the option as additional consideration for the asset and that no distribution arises. However, since the member has received value from the company in excess of the new consideration given, the full amount of the benefit received by the member should be treated as a distribution by the company.</p><sup>32</sup><h3>Assistance of District Valuer Services</h3><sup>33</sup><p>District Valuer Services may need to advise on the valuation of an asset-giving rise to a distribution</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\CTM15250.xml</p><hr/><sup>0</sup><h3>CTA10/S1000 (1) B and S1000 (1) G</h3><sup>1</sup><h3>CTA10/S1020</h3><sup>2</sup><p>Where a company transfers an asset to one of its members (or vice versa) CTA10/S1000 (1) G may apply.
