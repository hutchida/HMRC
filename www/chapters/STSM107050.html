This is because the units are not regarded as being ‘surrendered’ by the unit holders to the manager of the unit trust upon which a charge may otherwise arise.</p><sup>10</sup><p>The stamp exemption does not extend to an authorised unit trust which is converted to a non-UK OEIC or other foreign collective investment scheme. This is because an OEIC is defined, for the purposes of stamp duty and SDRT, as being a UK incorporated company.</p><sup>11</sup><p>See STSM101030 for the meaning of an authorised unit trust.</p><sup>12</sup><p>See STSM101050 for the meaning of an open-ended investment company.</p><sup>13</sup><p>See STSM021040 for the meaning of stocks or marketable securities.</p><sup>14</sup><p>See STSM101010 for the meaning of a collective investment scheme.</p><sup>15</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>16</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
