The decision did not identify the statutory duty as conclusive in itself, but referred to it in order to contrast the situation with that of the councils “making a grant to the companies to enable them to operate for their own purposes”.</p><sup>5</sup><p>Other factors considered were:</p><sup>6</sup><p>the Trusts were obliged to provide the Council with audited accounts and, without need for request, true and complete quarterly financial and monitoring reports detailing its income and expenditure as well as annual reports on all aspects of the company.</p><sup>7</sup><p>there are binding obligations which are being paid for by the Council. These may be enforceable</p><sup>8</sup><p>the relationship between the Trusts and the LAs is at arms length</p><sup>9</sup><p>there is an absence of control by the Council in the Trusts’ decision-making in that they are at liberty to dispense with Council services wherever possible</p><sup>10</sup><p>there was no question of deficit funding because the Trusts were not given whatever money turned out to be needed in a particular year, instead a sum was agreed which is the consideration for the service (although it was irrelevant that the consideration was calculated in advance on the basis that the Trusts should not suffer losses)</p><sup>11</sup><p>it was relevant that the customer thinks they are receiving something</p><sup>12</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>13</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
