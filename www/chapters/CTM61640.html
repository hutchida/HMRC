In its APs ended 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015 there are the following transactions with its participator (P):</p><p>31 December 2014 (AP1)&#160;</p><p>1 January 2014 loan by C to P of &#163;50,000</p><p>1 November 2014 P repays &#163;20,000 to C</p><p>20 November 2014 loan by C to P of &#163;10,000</p><p>15 December 2014 P repays &#163;10,000 to C</p><p>Year End Balance &#163;30,000</p><p>31 December 2015 (AP2)</p><p>1 January 2015 loan by C to P &#163;25,000</p><p>1 August 2015 repayment by P to C of &#163;35,000</p><p>1 November 2015 loan by C to P of &#163;55,000</p><p>Year End Balance &#163;75,000</p><p>AP1</p><p>Under the normal repayment provisions of CTA10/S458, the combination of the repayment of &#163;10,000 on 15 December 2014 along with the repayment of &#163;35,000 on 1 August 2015 within 9 months of the end of the AP would, without CTA10/S464C mean that there was no S455 charge for AP1. However, as the repayments on 15 December 2014 and 1 August 2015 are made on or after 20 March 2013, CTA10/S464C needs to be considered.</p><p>The first repayment to which S464C (1) can apply is that of &#163;10,000 on 15 December 2014. In the 30 day period from that date, a new loan, a new chargeable payment, of &#163;25,000 was made on 1 January 2015. The 30 day rule will therefore deny relief for the repayment of &#163;10,000 which will be matched with and hence treated as repaying part of the subsequent loan on 1 January 2015. At this point it looks as though there will be a Section 455 charge for AP1 on &#163;40,000.</p><p>However within 9 months of the end of the AP, there is a further repayment of &#163;35,000. This exceeds the original year end balance and is therefore meant to repay that year end balance such that no Section 455 is chargeable for AP1.</p><p>Looking first at the 30 day rule there is no chargeable payment within 30 days of the 1 August 2015 repayment, so the 30 day rule cannot apply to it. The &#8216;arrangements&#8217; rule will need to be considered. </p><p>Assuming there are &#8216;arrangements&#8217;, which will of course depend on the facts, the rule will apply as follows:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the amount of chargeable payments outstanding immediately before the repayment on 1 August 2015 is in excess of &#163;15,000. </p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>as the 1 August 2015 repayment is not made in the same 30 day period as the January 2015 chargeable payment and it is made after that chargeable payment it is not matched with that chargeable payment</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>all of the &#163;35,000 repayment is therefore matched with the &#163;55,000 available amount of the chargeable payment on 1 November 2015.
