The £50 relief only applies to gifts made in the course or furtherance of business and therefore not to those made for non-business purposes, including those applied to personal use (for example a gift to a relative or friend). (If an asset is purchased to be given to a relative or friend, the asset is not a business asset: the VAT incurred is not input tax).</p><sup>1</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>2</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
