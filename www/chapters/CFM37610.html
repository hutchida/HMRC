IFRS radically changes the way companies account for ‘hybrid’ loan relationships (see CFM25000). IAS 39 (or FRS 26) requires in many cases a company to divide (or ‘bifurcate’) the contract into the ‘host contract’ and an ‘embedded derivative’. The embedded derivative in such cases is the option to acquire shares, or the ‘contract for differences’, or other rights or obligations that meet the definition of a derivative under IAS 39 (see</p><sup>7</sup><p>For periods of account beginning on or after 1 January 2005 the tax rules match the prescribed accounting for such ‘hybrid’ instruments.
