6 April 2016, individuals with income for a tax year above £150,000 have their annual allowance for that tax year reduced on a tapered basis (a ‘reduced annual allowance’).</p><sup>3</sup><p>The annual allowance is reduced by £1 for every £2 of income above £150,000, subject to a minimum reduced annual allowance of £10,000.</p><sup>4</sup><p>Where the reduction would otherwise take an individual’s tapered annual allowance below £10,000 for the tax year, their reduced annual allowance for that year is set at £10,000.</p><sup>5</sup><h3>Examples</h3><sup>6</sup><p>Based on an annual allowance of £40,000 for the tax year.</p><sup>7</sup><p>An individual with income of £160,000 has a reduced annual allowance of £35,000 for the tax year.</p><sup>8</sup><p>(The £10,000 of income above £150,000 creates a reduction of £5,000 from the annual allowance of £40,000 - resulting in a reduced annual allowance for the tax year of £35,000.)</p><sup>9</sup><p>An individual with income of £215,000 has a reduced annual allowance of £10,000 for the tax year.</p><sup>10</sup><p>(The £65,000 of income above £150,000 creates a reduction of £32,500 which would otherwise have reduced the annual allowance to below £10,000 – in this case it would have been reduced to £7,500.)</p><sup>11</sup><p>If the reduction to be made from the annual allowance is not a multiple of £1, the reduction is rounded down to the nearest £1.</p><sup>12</sup><p>The income definition for the purpose of the tapered annual allowance is known as ‘adjusted income’. This definition is based on the individual’s taxable income after allowing for certain reliefs plus the value of their pension savings during the tax year.</p><sup>13</sup><p>The tapered annual allowance restriction is subject to an income floor of £110,000 known as ‘threshold income’. This definition is based on the individual’s taxable income after allowing for certain reliefs plus the value of certain pension-related salary sacrifice type arrangements.</p><sup>14</sup><p>An individual with threshold income of £110,000 or less for a tax year is not subject to the tapered annual allowance, regardless of the level of their adjusted income for that tax year.</p><sup>15</sup><h3>Income definitions</h3><sup>16</sup><p>The tapered annual allowance applies to an individual for any tax year from 6 April 2016 onwards when:</p><sup>17</sup><p>the individual’s adjusted income for the tax year is more than £150,000, and</p><sup>18</sup><p>the individual’s threshold income for the same tax year is more than £110,000.</p><sup>19</sup><h3>Adjusted income (over £150,000)</h3><sup>20</sup><p>The definition of adjusted income is:</p><sup>21</sup><p>the individual’s net income for the tax year as calculated under steps 1 and 2 of section 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007, plus</p><sup>22</sup><p>the amount of any relief under section 193(4) of Finance Act 2004 (a claim for excess relief under net pay, see</p><sup>23</sup><p>the amount of any pension contributions made from any employment income of the individual for the tax year under net pay, under section 193(2) of Finance Act 2004 (see</p><sup>24</sup><p>where non domiciled individuals make contributions to overseas pension schemes, any relief claimed under Chapter 2 of Part 5 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 for the tax year, plus</p><sup>25</sup><p>the value of any employer contributions for the tax year, but less</p><sup>26</sup><p>the amount of any lump sum death benefit mentioned in section 636A(4ZA) Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 that accrues to the individual in the tax year, see</p><sup>27</sup><p></p><sup>28</sup><p>In broad terms ‘net income’ is an individual’s taxable income left after deducting any reliefs due under section 24 of the Income Tax Act 2007.</p><sup>29</sup><p>An individual’s taxable income could include any of the following:</p><sup>30</sup><p>earnings from employment</p><sup>31</sup><p>earnings from self-employment/partnerships</p><sup>32</sup><p>most pensions income (State, occupational and personal pensions)</p><sup>33</sup><p>interest on most savings</p><sup>34</sup><p>income from shares (dividend income)</p><sup>35</sup><p>rental income</p><sup>36</sup><p>income received by an individual from a trust.</p><sup>37</sup><p></p><sup>38</sup><p>The value of the employer contributions for a tax year is found by taking the individual’s total pension input amount for the tax year less the total of any member contributions paid during the tax year.</p><sup>39</sup><p>The total pension input amount is calculated as usual. See the following</p><sup>40</sup><p>The total of any member contributions paid during a tax year means any contributions paid by the individual or any contributions paid by a third party on behalf of the individual (excluding any contributions paid in respect of the individual by the individual’s employer) to a:</p><sup>41</sup><p>registered pension scheme,</p><sup>42</sup><p>currently-relieved non-UK scheme, where the individual qualifies for relief in respect of the contributions due to being a currently-relieved member of that scheme (see</p><sup>43</sup><h3>Threshold Income (over £110,000)</h3><sup>44</sup><p>For this purpose the threshold income definition is:</p><sup>45</sup><p>the individual’s net income for the tax year as calculated under steps 1 and 2 of section 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007, less</p><sup>46</sup><p>the amount (before any deduction under section 192(1) Finance Act 2004) of any contribution paid in the year in respect of which the individual is entitled to be given relief under section 192 Finance Act 2004 (relief at source, see</p><sup>47</sup><p>the amount of any lump sum death benefits mentioned in section 636A(4ZA) Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 accruing to the individual in the tax year, plus</p><sup>48</sup><p>the amount of any reduction of employment income for pension provision as a result of any ‘relevant salary sacrifice arrangement’, or ‘relevant flexible remuneration arrangement’, made on or after 9 July 2015.</p><sup>49</sup><p></p><sup>50</sup><p>In broad terms ‘net income’ is an individual’s taxable income left after deducting any reliefs due under section 24 of the Income Tax Act 2007.</p><sup>51</sup><p>An individual’s taxable income could include any of the following:</p><sup>52</sup><p>earnings from employment</p><sup>53</sup><p>earnings from self-employment/partnerships</p><sup>54</sup><p>most pensions income (State, occupational and personal pensions)</p><sup>55</sup><p>interest on most savings</p><sup>56</sup><p>income from shares (dividend income)</p><sup>57</sup><p>rental income</p><sup>58</sup><p>income received by an individual from a trust.</p><sup>59</sup><p></p><sup>60</sup><p>A relevant salary sacrifice arrangement is where:</p><sup>61</sup><p>an individual gives up employment income in exchange for pension contributions by an employer, and</p><sup>62</sup><p>the salary sacrifice arrangement was made on or after 9 July 2015 (whether before or after the start of the employment concerned).</p><sup>63</sup><p>A relevant flexible remuneration arrangement is where:</p><sup>64</sup><p>an individual and their employer agree that pension contributions will be made by the employer rather than the individual receive some employment income, and</p><sup>65</sup><p>the flexible remuneration arrangement was made on or after 9 July 2015 (whether before or after the start of the employment concerned).</p><sup>66</sup><p></p><sup>67</sup><p>For the purpose of a relevant salary sacrifice or relevant flexible remuneration arrangement, ‘a pension contribution by an employer’ means an individual’s employer or some other person</p><sup>68</sup><p>paying contributions (or additional contributions) to a pension scheme in respect of the individual or otherwise</p><sup>69</sup><p>any person connected with the individual.</p><sup>70</sup><p>Section 993 of Income Tax Act 2007 defines a ‘connected person’ for this purpose (see</p><sup>71</sup><h3>Anti-avoidance rule for tapered annual allowance</h3><sup>72</sup><p>Section 228ZB Finance Act 2004</p><sup>73</sup><p>Where an individual enters into arrangements that meet the conditions set out below, those arrangements are disregarded for the purpose of calculating the individual’s reduced annual allowance. The amount by which the individual’s annual allowance is reduced due to the tapered annual allowance is treated as being what the reduction would be apart from those arrangements.</p><sup>74</sup><p>The conditions for the arrangements are:</p><sup>75</sup><p></p><sup>76</sup><p>Note - In condition A immediately above “reduce” includes reduce to nil.</p><sup>77</sup><p>Note - The increase mentioned in condition C immediately above may be an increase in what would be the individual’s adjusted income, or threshold income, for the tax year 2015-16 if the tapered annual allowance provisions:</p><sup>78</sup><p>had effect for that year, and</p><sup>79</sup><p>did so as if the ‘value of the employer contributions’ (as mentioned in the definition of ‘adjusted income’ in the</p><sup>80</sup><p>Note – for the purpose of this anti-avoidance rule ‘arrangements’ includes any agreement, understanding, scheme, transaction or series of transactions (whether or not legally enforceable).</p><sup>81</sup><p>Note - the terms ‘arrangements’ and ‘scheme’ are used here in the sense of avoidance devices rather than pension schemes or pension arrangements.</p><sup>82</sup><h3>Money purchase annual allowance</h3><sup>83</sup><p>For individuals who have flexibly accessed a money purchase arrangement and the tapered annual allowance applies to them</p><sup>84</sup><p>a money purchase annual allowance applies for ‘money-purchase inputs’, and</p><sup>85</sup><p>the ‘alternative’ annual allowance applies for ‘other inputs’.</p><sup>86</sup><p>The ‘alternative’ annual allowance is found by subtracting the money purchase annual allowance amount for the tax year from the amount of the reduced annual allowance for the tax year (i.e. following the reduction due to the taper).</p><sup>87</sup><p>For tax year 2016-17 only, the money purchase annual allowance is £10,000.</p><sup>88</sup><p>For tax year 2017-18 onwards, the money purchase annual allowance is £4,000.</p><sup>89</sup><p>If the minimum reduced annual allowance of £10,000 applies for a tax year, the minimum reduced alternative annual allowance for the same tax year depends on the year in question:</p><sup>90</sup><p>for tax year 2016-17 only, the alternative annual allowance is reduced to nil (reduced annual allowance for the year of £10,000 less the money purchase annual allowance for the year of £10,000)</p><sup>91</sup><p>for tax year 2017-18 onwards, the alternative annual allowance is reduced to £6,000 (reduced annual allowance for the year of £10,000 less the money purchase annual allowance for the year of £4,000).</p><sup>92</sup><p>Where flexible access has occurred the reduced annual allowance will apply unless applying the money purchase annual allowance results in a greater amount being chargeable to the annual allowance charge.</p><sup>93</sup><h3>Carrying forward unused annual allowance</h3><sup>94</sup><p>Any available unused annual allowance from recent previous tax years can be carried forward and added to the individual’s reduced annual allowance and, when applicable, the individual’s reduced alternative annual allowance.</p><sup>95</sup><p>If a previous tax year is tax year 2016-17 (or a later tax year) and the tapered annual allowance applied to the individual for the same tax year, either</p><sup>96</sup><p>the individual’s total pension input amount is tested against the individual’s reduced annual allowance, or</p><sup>97</sup><p>if applicable, the individual’s ‘other inputs’ are tested against the individual’s reduced alternative annual allowance</p><sup>98</sup><p>to determine if there is any unused annual allowance to carry forward from that year.</p><sup>99</sup><h3>Scheme Pays</h3><sup>100</sup><p>The tapered annual allowance applying for a tax year does not alter the ‘Scheme Pays’ conditions. In particular, it remains a requirement that the individual’s total amount of pension savings in the pension scheme for the tax year has to exceed the annual allowance amount in section 228 Finance Act 2004.</p><sup>101</sup><p>For tax year 2016-17, for example, that means the individual’s total amount of pension savings in the scheme has to exceed £40,000 and not the individual’s reduced annual allowance.</p><sup>102</sup><p></p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New
