For further information see STSM050000.</p><sup>2</sup><p>The 1.5 per cent charge applies to transactions in UK shares but not in foreign shares (even if they are on a UK register or ‘paired’ with UK shares) - see FA86/S99 (10).</p><sup>3</sup><p>These are the same rates as ad valorem stamp duty but the rounding provisions are different. The SDRT charge is rounded to the nearest penny if necessary, taking 0.5 pence as nearest to the next whole penny above.</p><sup>4</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>5</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
