Tax legislation provides that from 6 April 2010 normal minimum pension age is age 55 (before 6 April 2010 it was age 50).</p><p>Registered schemes are also not permitted to have a normal&#160;pension age lower than age 55 and this applies equally to individuals in occupations that usually retire before 55 (for example, professional sports people or hazardous occupations).</p><h3>Taking benefits</h3><p>Although the legislation provides the minimum age at which benefits can be taken, the rules of a particular scheme will state what benefits can be taken and the age at which they can be taken from. The age at which they can be taken from can be higher than normal minimum pension age.</p><p>Members may be paid benefits from different schemes or part of an arrangement within the same scheme at different times (subject to the scheme rules), and the tax legislation also does not require member&#8217;s to have retired before they can take benefits.
