The following response was supplied to the Court of Appeal;</p><sup>8</sup><p>“The rules on determining the scope of a transaction do not preclude an exemption of a Member State, under Article 28(2)(a) of Sixth Directive 77/388/EC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment, which zero-rates the supply of specified goods and excludes other items from the scope of the zero-rating, even if the excluded items and the included items are delivered together”.</p><sup>9</sup><p>The ECJ found that the UK was correct in restricting the zero rating for caravans to the supply of the caravan itself, while applying VAT at the standard rate to removable contents provided with the caravan, albeit that there was a single supply.</p><sup>10</sup><p>This case does not give information on how to decide whether there is a single or multiple supply as the starting point is that there is a single supply and the issue is about whether there can be more than one VAT liability applied to it.</p><sup>11</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>12</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
