If A agrees to sell securities to B who agrees to sell them on to C before B’s purchase has completed, then there are potentially two charges to SDRT. If the transfer from A to C is effected by an instrument of transfer which is duly stamped, this cancels only the SDRT on the agreement for transfer to C. The initial agreement between A and B will still give rise to a charge to SDRT.</p><sup>7</sup><p>Special rules apply regarding the cancellation and repayment of SDRT payable on an ‘own-shares agreement’ (an agreement to transfer shares in a company to that company - FA86/S92 (1C and 1D).</p><sup>8</sup><p> Previous page</p></div></body></html>
