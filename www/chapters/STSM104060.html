A corresponding SDRT charge applies to the surrender or transfer of shares in an Open-Ended Investment Company (OEIC) to the Authorised Corporate Director of the OEIC by virtue of the Stamp Duty &amp; Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (Open-Ended Investment Companies) Regulations 1987 (SI 1997/1156).</p><sup>1</sup><p>Specifically, SDRT is calculated by reference to the total value of all units (or OEIC shares) that are surrendered during a one-week ‘charging period’. A ‘charging period’ means a week covering a period of seven days beginning with a Sunday.</p><sup>2</sup><p>Paragraph 4 FA99/SCH19 provides for a reduction of SDRT payable during a ‘charging week’ where the total number of units or OEIC shares surrendered to the fund manager in a ‘relevant two-week period’ exceeds the number of units or OEIC shares of the same ‘class’ issued by the fund manager in that period.</p><sup>3</sup><p>The amount of SDRT payable can be further reduced under Paragraph 5 FA99/SCH19 if, in the relevant two-week period, the trust or OEIC property holds both exempt and non-exempt investments.</p><sup>4</sup><p>The reduction is made by applying the following fraction to the total value of surrendered units/OEIC shares in the charging week (after any reduction resulting from surrenders exceeding issues in the relevant two-week-period):-</p><sup>5</sup><p>Where:-</p><sup>6</sup><p>‘N’ is the average value of the non-exempt investments over the relevant two-week period; and</p><sup>7</sup><p>‘E’ is the average market value of the exempt investments over that period.</p><sup>8</sup><p>The ‘relevant two-week period’ in relation to a surrender, means the period from the beginning of the charging week in which the surrender occurs to the end of the following week.</p><sup>9</sup><p>Cash or other funds held for day to day management are not classed as investments. So the N/(N+E) fraction does not include cash either in the numerator or the denominator. This means, for example, that a fund holding only cash and United Kingdom shares will not qualify for this relief.</p><sup>10</sup><p>If the total investments in the fund are exempt (so that there are no non-exempt investments) or there are no new issues of units/OEIC shares in the particular two-week period in point, then the fraction is zero and there will be no SDRT to account for and pay on the surrenders in the charging week concerned.</p><sup>11</sup><p>A non-exempt investment means any investment that is not an exempt investment.</p><sup>12</sup><p>See STSM101020 for the meaning of a unit trust.</p><sup>13</sup><p>See STSM101050 for the meaning of an open-ended investment company.</p><sup>14</sup><p>See STSM104070 for the meaning of ‘average value’ for the N/(N+E) calculation.</p><sup>15</sup><p>See STSM105020 and STSM105040 for the meaning of an exempt investment.</p><sup>16</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>17</sup><p> Next page</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\STSM104060.xml</p><hr/><sup>title</sup><h3 style="background-color: #FFFF00">Collectives: Calculation Of The Charge: Reduction Of Stamp Duty Reserve Tax Where Exempt Investments Are Held By A Fund</h3><sup>0</sup><p>The provisions of paragraphs 2 &amp; 3 of FA99/SCH19 impose a charge to Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) at the rate of 0.5 per cent on the market value of a unit which is surrendered or otherwise transferred to the manager of that unit trust.
