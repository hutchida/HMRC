A corresponding SDRT charge applies to the surrender or transfer of shares in an Open-Ended Investment Company (OEIC) to the Authorised Corporate Director of the OEIC by virtue of the Stamp Duty &amp; Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (Open-Ended Investment Companies) Regulations 1987 (SI 1997/1156).</p><p>Specifically, SDRT is calculated by reference to the total value of all units (or OEIC shares) that are surrendered during a one-week &#8216;charging period&#8217;. A &#8216;charging period&#8217; means a week covering a period of seven days beginning with a Sunday.</p><p>Paragraph 4 FA99/SCH19 provides for a reduction of SDRT payable during a &#8216;charging week&#8217; where the total number of units or OEIC shares surrendered to the fund manager in a &#8216;relevant two-week period&#8217; exceeds the number of units or OEIC shares of the same &#8216;class&#8217; issued by the fund manager in that period.</p><p>The amount of SDRT payable can be further reduced under Paragraph 5 FA99/SCH19 if, in the relevant two-week period, the trust or OEIC property holds both exempt and non-exempt investments.</p><p>The reduction is made by applying the following fraction to the total value of surrendered units/OEIC shares in the charging week (after any reduction resulting from surrenders exceeding issues in the relevant two-week-period):-</p><p><emph typestyle="un">&#160;N&#160;</emph><nl /> N+E</p><p>Where:-</p><p>&#8216;N&#8217; is the average value of the non-exempt investments over the relevant two-week period; and</p><p>&#8216;E&#8217; is the average market value of the exempt investments over that period.</p><p>The &#8216;relevant two-week period&#8217; in relation to a surrender, means the period from the beginning of the charging week in which the surrender occurs to the end of the following week.</p><p>Cash or other funds held for day to day management are not classed as investments. So the N/(N+E) fraction does not include cash either in the numerator or the denominator. This means, for example, that a fund holding only cash and United Kingdom shares will not qualify for this relief.</p><p>If the total investments in the fund are exempt (so that there are no non-exempt investments) or there are no new issues of units/OEIC shares in the particular two-week period in point, then the fraction is zero and there will be no SDRT to account for and pay on the surrenders in the charging week concerned.</p><p>A non-exempt investment means any investment that is not an exempt investment.</p><p>See <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM101020:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">STSM101020</remotelink> for the meaning of a unit trust.</p><p>See <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM101050:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">STSM101050</remotelink> for the meaning of an open-ended investment company.</p><p>See <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM104070:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">STSM104070</remotelink> for the meaning of &#8216;average value&#8217; for the N/(N+E) calculation.</p><p>See <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM105020:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">STSM105020</remotelink> and <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM105040:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">STSM105040</remotelink> for the meaning of an exempt investment.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM104050:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM104070:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>The provisions of paragraphs 2 &amp; 3 of FA99/SCH19 impose a charge to Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) at the rate of 0.5 per cent on the market value of a unit which is surrendered or otherwise transferred to the manager of that unit trust.
