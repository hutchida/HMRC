As the inclusion of swing gives the buyer greater flexibility we consider that a higher price should be paid for gas sold under a contract containing a provision for swing. The value of swing can, in theory, be determined in a number of ways, but the most common ways that LB Oil &amp; Gas has seen are comparing the alternative costs of storage and the use of forward prices. The Transco storage booklet contains a computation of the cost of swing determined by comparison to the costs of using the Rough storage facilities.</p><sup>1</sup><h4>Example:</h4><sup>2</sup><p>The example below shows how published prices can be used to value swing. It is based on the assumption of sales of 500,000 therms a day, on the basis of 130% swing which will be fully utilised in the period January to March and the need to balance sales at 500,000 therms a day over the whole of the year. The prices are purely illustrative.</p><sup>3</sup><p>=</p><sup>4</sup><p>=</p><sup>5</sup><p>Value of 30% swing = Â£33.93m \ 500,000 Th\day\ 365 days = 18.592p\Th</p><sup>6</sup><p>Less</p><sup>7</sup><p>Cost of annual flat gas at 18p\Th</p><sup>8</sup><p>30% swing costs 0.592 p\Th</p><sup>9</sup><p>It can therefore be inferred that 10% swing costs 0.197 p\Th (that is, 0.592\3).</p><sup>10</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>11</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
