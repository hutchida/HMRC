But for periods to 5 April 2012 TCGA92/S252 prevented that exemption from applying to a debt which was not in sterling and which represented a credit balance in a bank account. Such a debt was a chargeable asset and each withdrawal from the account was a (part) disposal of the debt. Consideration for the disposal may have taken the form of currency or a new debt (eg a credit balance in another account); for the purposes of computing the gain, the value of the consideration was the value in sterling of the asset received obtained, where necessary, using the sterling exchange rate at the time of the disposal.

This included expenditure on the provision or maintenance of any residence outside the United Kingdom. This provision was similar to TCGA92/S269 and the guidance at CG78315 applies to it also.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CG78321:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CG78323:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><h3>TCGA92/S252</h3><p>When foreign currency was deposited in a bank account there was, for Capital Gains Tax purposes, a disposal of the currency for its sterling value at that time.
