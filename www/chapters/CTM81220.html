In determining whether, and to what extent, there exists surplus ACT for the purposes of Section 239 (3), the following order of set-off is applied. Where for any accounting period a subsidiary has available for set-off:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>ACT paid in respect of its own distributions, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>ACT surrendered to it,</p></li><p>the surrendered amount is regarded as having been set-off against the subsidiary&#8217;s CT liability in priority to the ACT paid on its own distributions. </p><p>A similar order of set-off applies in determining whether any amount of surplus ACT brought forward to an accounting period includes an amount of ACT surrendered to the company. ACT surrendered to the company is again regarded as having been set-off against its liability to CT in priority to ACT paid by the company in respect of its own distributions. The point will be relevant if a company wants to carry back from an accounting period ACT brought forward to that period.</p><h3>ICTA88/S240 (5)</h3><p>Under ICTA88/S240 (5), a subsidiary which receives surrendered ACT cannot set that ACT against its CT liability for any accounting period (beginning before 6 April 1999) in which, or in any part of which, it is not a 51% subsidiary of the surrendering company.The effect of this is that any unused ACT is lost. </p><p>But the rule above does not apply for accounting periods ending on or after 14 March 1989 where there is a group reorganisation, and both the surrendering and receiving companies remain 51% subsidiaries of a third company. This intra-group saving provision was enacted to assist commercially desirable reorganisations. </p><p>However the protection it provides is lost if ICTA88/S245A applies. ICTA88/S245A restricts the set-off of surrendered ACT in certain circumstances, and there is guidance on this at <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM81225:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CTM81225</remotelink>. </p><p>The circumstances in which Section 245A operates are where:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>there is a major change in the nature or conduct of the surrendering company&#8217;s trade or business, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the receiving company was not a 75% subsidiary of the third company when it was transferred within the group (<remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM06350:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CTM06350</remotelink>).</p></li><p>This order of set-off is also important where a company has carried back ACT from a later period and subsequently receives surrendered ACT. (Remember, a surrender claim canbe made up to six years after the end of an accounting period but the carry back claim must be made within two.) In that case, the surrendered ACT displaces the ACT previously carried back.
