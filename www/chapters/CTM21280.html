None of the ACT of £1,250 has been dealt with.</p><sup>54</sup><p>The CT position for the period ended 31 December 1995 has been considered above.

The calculation for the DFP on this foreign source profit was:</p><sup>60</sup><p>Of the £6,500 available, only £5,000 has been matched against an FID. So the portion of the total DFP available which is matched is £5,000 / £6,500, and the matched FSP underlying the matched eligible profits are £5,000 / £6,500 x £10,000 = £7692.</p><sup>61</sup><p>The £7,692 is treated as the profits chargeable to CT.

The ACT which the company would have paid in respect of the qualifying FID is £2,122 (£8,490 / 4).</p><sup>66</sup><p>The matched FSP underlying the matched DFP are treated as the profits chargeable to CT. These FSP came in the form of £10,000 dividends from Company E and also part of the £4,000 dividends from Company F. The calculation for the DFP on this last foreign source profit was:</p><sup>67</sup><p>The portion of the Company F FSP underlying the matched DFP is calculated in the same way as above £1,900 / £2,680 x £4,000 = £2,970.</p><sup>68</sup><p>So the matched FSP underlying the matched DFP amount to £12,970 (£10,000 + £2,970).</p><sup>69</sup><p>In computing the notional CT, where any deduction has been given in reaching on FSP notional DTR is again found by reference to the FSP plus that deduction.</p><sup>70</sup><p>Thus for the dividend of £2,970 from company F the DTR is £1,990 / £2,680 x £1,320 =£980 which equals the notional CT liability on that dividend, and no ACT is set off.</p><sup>71</sup><p>The notional CT liability on the dividend from Company E is also fully covered by DTR.</p><sup>72</sup><p>The notional foreign source ACT is therefore £2,122.</p><sup>73</sup><p>The ACT which is available for repayment or set off under the FID provisions is then the lower of the ACT not already dealt with - £3,623 and the notional foreign source ACT -£2,122.

The company now elects to match £7,800 of those FID with £7,800 of the DFP of 1997, and elects for these FID to be qualifying FID.</p><sup>101</sup><p>Because the company has previously made a payment under ICTA88/S246U (2) in respect of 1996, and has now matched FID paid in 1996 with DFP in 1997, the company is due a repayment.</p><sup>102</sup><p>The repayment is found by recalculating what the 1996 amount A minus amount B payment would have been, if the 1997 matched DFP had been taken into account before calculating that payment.</p><sup>103</sup><p>Amount A in respect of the FID paid in 1996 is unchanged at £3,750.
