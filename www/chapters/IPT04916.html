In these circumstances the same principle, as explained in IPT04910 will apply that the higher rate of IPT does not apply to this type of GAP insurance, but does apply to non-financial GAP insurance. If the insurance relates to a financial agreement, for example a hire purchase agreement, then the insurance remains at the standard rate of IPT. However, where the insurance relates to the goods sold then the higher rate will apply.
