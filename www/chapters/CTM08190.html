For periods before this date only the first argument can be applied (see CTM08240 for an explanation). The issue has been tested in the recent (2004) case of Camas PLC v Atkinson TL3728. The Courts considered whether such expenditure was an expense of management. They considered the earlier management expenses cases and in particular the ‘severability’ test which had formed the basis of the decision in Sun Life.</p><sup>10</sup><p>Using that test the Revenue had contended that expenditure could not be severed from the costs of acquisition of an investment once a particular target had been identified. This view had been supported by the Irish Supreme Court case, Hibernian v Macuimis 2000ITR75.</p><sup>11</sup><p>This argument was rejected. The Courts concluded that expenditure does not form part of the acquisition costs until, at the earliest, the date of the decision to acquire the investment. Prior to that date the expenditure is generally preparatory to a decision to acquire and as such is not closely enough linked to the acquisition to form part of the acquisition costs. Expenditure does not cease to be on management simply because a target has been identified.</p><sup>12</sup><p>Even after there has been a decision to acquire, expenditure could still qualify for relief as expenses of management (see below).</p><sup>13</sup><p>Expenditure preparatory to making a decision to purchase will generally be an expense of management. Once the decision to acquire has been made then the expenditure is likely to fall into the category of ‘costs of implementation of a purchase already decided upon’ and will therefore not be an expense of management.</p><sup>14</sup><p>The decision to acquire/purchase would normally be evidenced at the latest by for example an offer being made to the target company, when the expenditure ceases to be on decision making and becomes part of the implementation of a purchase already decided upon. Up to that point the expenses are generally all on decision-making and are not sufficiently direct costs of the acquisition.</p><sup>15</sup><p>But the date of the decision to acquire does not necessarily provide an absolute cut-off point in deciding whether expenditure of this nature is or is not an expense of management. In this context we are looking to differentiate between decision making expenditure and costs of implementation of a purchase already decided upon, the former being expenses of management and the latter not.</p><sup>16</sup><p>In each case the detailed facts should be considered as they are crucial. If expenditure relates to managerial decision making then even if the expenditure occurs after the date of the decision to acquire/dispose, it could be expenses of management.
