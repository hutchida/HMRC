PARA18 provides for a fundamental protection in respect of information notices: a notice can only require a person to produce a document if it is in that person’s possession or power.</p><sup>5</sup><h4>Restrictions on information powers</h4><sup>6</sup><p>FA08/SCH36/PARA19 deals with types of documents that a notice cannot require to be produced, with exceptions. In particular, a person cannot be required to produce materials relating to the conduct of a pending appeal. Also personal records (as defined in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984/S12), unless sufficiently redacted so as to no longer be a personal record.</p><sup>7</sup><p>FA08/SCH36/PARA 20 limits the right to documents originating more than 6 years before a notice.</p><sup>8</sup><p>FA08/SCH36/PARA 23 relates to privileged communications between professional legal advisers and clients; a notice cannot require the production of documents in relation to which privilege could be maintained in legal proceedings.</p><sup>9</sup><p>FA08/SCH36/PARA 24 protects information held in connection with an auditor’s duties. PARA25 relates to tax advisers’ documents, and protects relevant communications and documents relating giving tax advice, where these are the adviser’s property, and relate to communications with the taxpayer or another adviser. In neither case does this protection extend to advice or information held in connection with the provision of information or documents by the taxpayer to HMRC - PARA26. It is possible for a document to be protected by PARAS24 or 25 in part only - PARA27.</p><sup>10</sup><h4>Penalties and offences</h4><sup>11</sup><p>FA08/SCH36/PART7 contains detailed penalty provisions for the general information powers, see CFM99110.
