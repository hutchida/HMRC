Some transactions which at first sight appear to be a supply of services are deemed to be a supply of goods. In the same way, others which appear to be a supply of goods are treated as a supply of services. Further guidance is given in VATSC70000.</p><sup>2</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>3</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
