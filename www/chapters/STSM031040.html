It applies regardless of whether the agreement has been completed (but see STSM031140 for the procedure if an instrument is stamped).</p><sup>6</sup><p>The charge applies equally to written and oral agreements.</p><sup>7</sup><p>Under FA86/S86 (4), SDRT is chargeable regardless of whether the agreement is made in the UK and whether any party to the agreement is located or resident in the UK.</p><sup>8</sup><p>An agreement between A and B to transfer chargeable securities creates a charge to SDRT even if the transfer is to a third party (C). It is the agreement itself that creates the charge. Under FA86/S91, B is liable for the tax, even if the transfer is to C.</p><sup>9</sup><p>For chargeable securities to be transferred, there must be an assignment of a pre-existing proprietary interest in those securities. This does not cover, for example:</p><sup>10</sup><p>the issue of securities, for example on subscription or a bonus issue. A rights issue does not in itself involve a transfer of securities, but rights to subscribe for chargeable securities are themselves chargeable securities.</p><sup>11</sup><p>the grant or creation of new rights, such as options, where no pre-existing proprietary interest exists.</p><sup>12</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>13</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
