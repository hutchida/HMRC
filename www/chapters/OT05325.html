Such a day is called a “non-publication day” If that happens then extend the run of days backwards, if the gap occurs before the NDD, or forwards (if the gap occurs after the NDD) to include one or more extra days to make up the run of days to five, see</p><sup>34</sup><h4>Find the average of the 5 daily averages</h4><sup>35</sup><p>These steps for the 2-1-2. 3-2 or 2-3 methods will give a series of exactly five daily average prices, which then must be averaged to give the market value for the NDD in question.</p><sup>36</sup><h4>Brent blend: Add the adjustment factor (AF) (Regulation 14)</h4><sup>37</sup><p>To calculate this number, analogous to the commercial differential to the marker crude, daily differentials for the three PRAs for each day 14 to 21 days (inclusive) before the NDD have to be calculated.</p><sup>38</sup><p>There will be gaps in this run of 8 days.

Since the “market price” is by convention measured in $ per barrel, multiplying the “market price” by the volume (measured in barrels) will produce a total market value measured in $.
