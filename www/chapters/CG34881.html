If an election for separate assessment is in force it extends to gains made by a settlement and attributed to her as settlor under the above provisions in the same way as it extends to gains she makes directly. From 6 April 1990 husbands and wives are taxed independently on their gains including gains on which they are liable to tax as a result of these provisions, but the interests and benefits of a settlor’s spouse under a settlement are still taken into account in determining whether Section 77 applies.</p><sup>1</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>2</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
