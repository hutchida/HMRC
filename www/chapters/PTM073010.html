So, if the individual is a basic rate taxpayer, the rate is basic rate and if the individual is a higher rate taxpayer the rate is the higher rate applying to the individual.</p><sup>47</sup><p>The pension payer should use the following PAYE codes:</p><sup>48</sup><p>If the recipient has a P45 from a previous source/employment dated on or after 6 April in the current year, the scheme administrator should operate the code on the P45 on a Month 1 basis.</p><sup>49</sup><p>If a scheme administrator already makes payments to the recipient and has a tax code for those payments, the tax code should only be used for additional payments if the payments are being made at the same time. If more than one payment in a month is made and the same tax code is operated against each of those payments it could give the benefit of the tax allowances and rate bands twice.</p><sup>50</sup><p>For other trivial commutation lump sum death benefits and winding up lump sum death benefits, use the BR code.</p><sup>51</sup><p>In all other circumstances, scheme administrators should use the emergency code on a Month 1 basis against the payment and HMRC will issue a tax code to operate against future payments.</p><sup>52</sup><p>Further guidance on how to operate PAYE correctly on these lump sums can be found in CWG2 - Employer’s further guide to PAYE and NICs (GOV.UK).</p><sup>53</sup><p>There is also guidance for pension schemes on how to operate PAYE on the gov.uk website at https://www.gov.uk/paying-a-company-pension-or-annuity-through-your-payroll. This includes guidance on how to operate PAYE on trivial and winding up lump sums.</p><sup>54</sup><p>Where the beneficiary is receiving a lump sum payment that extinguishes the fund, the scheme administrator must issue a P45 which will enable the recipient to claim any tax refund that might be due in-year.</p><sup>55</sup><p>Because of the way PAYE works, using the emergency or BR code on these lump sum payments may mean that the recipient ends up paying too much tax. Where this does happen, the person who has paid too much tax can claim the tax back in-year. Scheme members can find more information on claiming a tax refund on the gov.uk website at https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-pension-death-benefits.</p><sup>56</sup><p>Many of the people affected won’t know that they may have paid too much tax and so are entitled to a tax refund. To help the people affected it would be helpful if the pension payer includes advice on how to claim a refund when issuing the lump sum payment. Some suggested wording that the pension payers could use is shown below. This will also help the payer by reducing the number of enquiries they may get on how the lump sum has been taxed and claiming refunds.</p><sup>57</sup><h3>Suggested wording pension payers can use when making the PAYE lump sum payment</h3><sup>58</sup><p>“Your form P45 details include the amount of tax deducted from your lump sum death benefit.
