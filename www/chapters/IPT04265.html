However, while general insurance policies are usually indemnity- based, and long-term policies are usually contingency-based, there are some exceptions.

These are class II, Marriage and Birth (written for a period of more than one year) and class IV, Permanent Health (written for a period of not less than five years, until normal retirement age or without time limit). However, any contract that is covered by Schedule 1 part II of the RAO 2001 may be treated as exempt even if they are cancelled or paid off early. For example, a life insurance contract written to cover a policyholder for one month, or a Permanent Health contract originally written without limit of time but which is terminated after 3 months.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT04260:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT04270:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>This section offers general guidelines by which to identify long term insurance.</p><p>Perhaps the most obvious way of spotting a long-term policy is that only a company authorised to write long-term business may underwrite it.
