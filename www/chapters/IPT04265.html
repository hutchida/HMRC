However, any contract that is covered by Schedule 1 part II of the RAO 2001 may be treated as exempt even if they are cancelled or paid off early. For example, a life insurance contract written to cover a policyholder for one month, or a Permanent Health contract originally written without limit of time but which is terminated after 3 months.</p><sup>11</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>12</sup><p> Next page</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\IPT04265.xml</p><hr/><sup>title</sup><h3>Long-Term Business: Definition Of</h3><sup>0</sup><p>This section offers general guidelines by which to identify long term insurance.</p><sup>1</sup><p>Perhaps the most obvious way of spotting a long-term policy is that only a company authorised to write long-term business may underwrite it.
