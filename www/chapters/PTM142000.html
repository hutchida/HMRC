Because of the difference between how obligations can arise under scheme rules and when the tax rules recognise an actual entitlement to the payment of pension (see</p><sup>22</sup><p>This issue only really affected scheme pensions, since money purchase pots would be likely to continue to grow during any delay, and a lifetime annuity that starts later would usually pay a higher level of pension than would have been paid had the annuity begun on time - whereas for defined benefit rights, factoring in increases was not always possible, as the member’s pension level was set by the scheme rules.</p><sup>23</sup><p>These regulations operate so the payment of arrears of scheme pension which have accrued, to which the member is entitled at the time when the pension begins to be paid and which is taxable pension income within the meaning of section 579B Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 is an authorised member payment.</p><sup>24</sup><p>The payment must not exceed the amount accrued during the period ending with the date on which the member became entitled to the pension (“the actual start date”) and beginning with the earliest date from which the member could, at the actual start date, have required the scheme administrator, in accordance with the rules of the scheme, to make a payment of arrears of pension.</p><sup>25</sup><p>For cases where the member has died before becoming actually entitled (according to the tax rules) to the arrear, see</p><sup>26</sup><p>Although as stated above a lifetime annuity that starts later than the date when it could have started under the scheme rules will usually pay a higher level of pension, due to the pot being larger than it was at the time it could have started, arrears of lifetime annuity income can also be paid as authorised pension in certain circumstances. Some annuity providers will offer an annuity contract allowing payments to be paid to the member in respect of a period before the annuity was set up, backdated to the date from which that member had the right to be paid a pension under the scheme rules.</p><sup>27</sup><p>Where an amount of arrears in respect of a period before the contract was set up was paid at the time the annuity started (and where the annuity entitlement arose before 6 April 2015), we would not consider that the ‘amount of the annuity’ had decreased, if the periodic amount paid in respect of the earlier period was paid at the same rate pro rata as the payments to be made going forward.</p><sup>28</sup><p>This is because for an annuity where the entitlement arose before 6 April 2015, it was a requirement for the annuity to qualify as a lifetime annuity that the amount of the annuity must not decrease. That condition does not apply for annuities where the entitlement arises on or after 6 April 2015. In either case, the entitlement to the lifetime annuity still arises when all the necessary steps have been taken as described on page</p><sup>29</sup><p>As the annuity payments paid late are considered to be authorised under section 165 FA 2004, there is no need to make provision in secondary legislation to authorise them.</p><sup>30</sup><h3>Contracted-out rights earned between 1961 and 1975 and restoring state pension scheme rights</h3><sup>31</sup><p>The Registered Pension Schemes (Authorised Payments) Regulations 2006 - SI 2006/209</p><sup>32</sup><p>The payment of lump sums representing commuted equivalent pension benefits (contracted-out rights earned between 1961 and 1975) is also an authorised payment providing the payment is made in accordance with the relevant DWP legislation (as described in regulation 2(a) of The Registered Pension Schemes (Authorised Payments) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/209).

The maximum amount of each payment is £500, and it must be paid from a money purchase arrangement or a hybrid arrangement directly to the financial advisor providing the advice. To be an authorised payment it must also satisfy the following conditions</p><sup>80</sup><p>the payment is made for retirement financial advice (see below) provided to the member, or for the implementation of such advice,</p><sup>81</sup><p>the member made a written request - which must have contained certain declarations (see below) - to the scheme for the payment</p><sup>82</sup><p>the member must not have requested more than two pension advice allowance payments already (across all registered pension schemes of which they are a member) and no more than two pension advice allowance payments must have actually been made already in respect of them.</p><sup>83</sup><p>no other pension advice allowance payment must have been made in respect of the member in the tax year in which the new written request is made,</p><sup>84</sup><p>the advice provided must be regulated financial advice, provided by a financial advisor regulated and authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority to provide such advice.</p><sup>85</sup><h3>Declarations required</h3><sup>86</sup><p>The member must make a declaration that</p><sup>87</sup><p>no more than two pension advice allowance payments have been requested and made in respect of them, across all their registered pension schemes. Note that the maximum of three payments of pension advice allowance applies per person, regardless of their capacity in relation to any particular pension scheme. For example, where a person has had two pension advice allowance payments made in relation to schemes of which they are a member in their own right, and then becomes a member of a scheme in their capacity as a beneficiary of another member who has died, only one more payment of pension advice allowance would be authorised under the tax rules for that person,</p><sup>88</sup><p>they have not requested a pension advice allowance payment already in the tax year in which they now make a written request, and that no such payment has been made in respect of them that tax year</p><sup>89</sup><p>the advice provided to them is regulated financial advice (see below), provided by a financial advisor regulated and authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority to provide such advice.</p><sup>90</sup><h3>Retirement financial advice</h3><sup>91</sup><p>The payment must be used to pay for retirement financial advice for the person requesting it, or the implementation of such advice. Regulated financial advice means advice in respect of the person’s financial position, including their pension arrangements and the use of their pension funds. HMRC is satisfied that this includes advice on how to use assets to fund care in old age, advice on whether in retirement the person will need to access sources of income other than their pension savings (for example, by equity release from their home), and advice on how to draw an income for retirement from all their pension pots and their stocks and shares ISA, but does not include inheritance tax planning or advice solely on an investment fund that will not be used for retirement income.</p><sup>92</sup><h3>Regulated financial advice</h3><sup>93</sup><p>Regulated financial advice means advice covered by Article 53 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 - SI 2001/544.</p><sup>94</sup><h3>Amount of payment</h3><sup>95</sup><p>The amount of each payment must not exceed £500. Only one payment in respect of a person may be made in a tax year, and only three in the person’s lifetime. This means that if advice costing £375 in respect of a person is paid for using this allowance in a tax year, no further payment may be made until the following tax year at the earliest. There is no facility to carry forward any unused allowance, nor to make two payments in respect of the same person in the same tax year even if they total no more than £500.</p><sup>96</sup><h3>Taxation of the pension advice allowance</h3><sup>97</sup><p>The member or beneficiary is not liable to income tax on payments of the pension advice allowance made in respect of them.</p><sup>98</sup><h3>Small lump sums and also genuine errors</h3><sup>99</sup><p>The Registered Pension Schemes (Authorised Payments) Regulations 2009 - SI 2009/1171</p><sup>100</sup><p>These regulations set out two broad categories of authorised payments to, or in respect of a member.

For further details, see</p><sup>76</sup><h3>Payments of pension advice allowance</h3><sup>77</sup><p>The Registered Pension Schemes (Authorised Payments) Regulations 2009 - SI 2009/1171</p><sup>78</sup><p>Article 53 Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 - SI 2001/544</p><sup>79</sup><p>From 6 April 2017, at the request of a member (including a person who is a member in their capacity of a dependant, nominee or successor of a member who has died) a registered pension scheme may make one payment of pension advice allowance in respect of that person in a tax year. The maximum amount of each payment is £500, and it must be paid from a money purchase arrangement or a hybrid arrangement directly to the financial advisor providing the advice. To be an authorised payment it must also satisfy the following conditions</p><sup>80</sup><p>the payment is made for retirement financial advice (see below) provided to the member, or for the implementation of such advice,</p><sup>81</sup><p>the member made a written request - which must have contained certain declarations (see below) - to the scheme for the payment</p><sup>82</sup><p>the member must not have requested more than two pension advice allowance payments already (across all registered pension schemes of which they are a member) and no more than two pension advice allowance payments must have actually been made already in respect of them.</p><sup>83</sup><p>no other pension advice allowance payment must have been made in respect of the member in the tax year in which the new written request is made,</p><sup>84</sup><p>the advice provided must be regulated financial advice, provided by a financial advisor regulated and authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority to provide such advice.</p><sup>85</sup><h3>Declarations required</h3><sup>86</sup><p>The member must make a declaration that</p><sup>87</sup><p>no more than two pension advice allowance payments have been requested and made in respect of them, across all their registered pension schemes. Note that the maximum of three payments of pension advice allowance applies per person, regardless of their capacity in relation to any particular pension scheme. For example, where a person has had two pension advice allowance payments made in relation to schemes of which they are a member in their own right, and then becomes a member of a scheme in their capacity as a beneficiary of another member who has died, only one more payment of pension advice allowance would be authorised under the tax rules for that person,</p><sup>88</sup><p>they have not requested a pension advice allowance payment already in the tax year in which they now make a written request, and that no such payment has been made in respect of them that tax year</p><sup>89</sup><p>the advice provided to them is regulated financial advice (see below), provided by a financial advisor regulated and authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority to provide such advice.</p><sup>90</sup><h3>Retirement financial advice</h3><sup>91</sup><p>The payment must be used to pay for retirement financial advice for the person requesting it, or the implementation of such advice. Regulated financial advice means advice in respect of the person’s financial position, including their pension arrangements and the use of their pension funds. HMRC is satisfied that this includes advice on how to use assets to fund care in old age, advice on whether in retirement the person will need to access sources of income other than their pension savings (for example, by equity release from their home), and advice on how to draw an income for retirement from all their pension pots and their stocks and shares ISA, but does not include inheritance tax planning or advice solely on an investment fund that will not be used for retirement income.</p><sup>92</sup><h3>Regulated financial advice</h3><sup>93</sup><p>Regulated financial advice means advice covered by Article 53 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 - SI 2001/544.</p><sup>94</sup><h3>Amount of payment</h3><sup>95</sup><p>The amount of each payment must not exceed £500. Only one payment in respect of a person may be made in a tax year, and only three in the person’s lifetime. This means that if advice costing £375 in respect of a person is paid for using this allowance in a tax year, no further payment may be made until the following tax year at the earliest. There is no facility to carry forward any unused allowance, nor to make two payments in respect of the same person in the same tax year even if they total no more than £500.</p><sup>96</sup><h3>Taxation of the pension advice allowance</h3><sup>97</sup><p>The member or beneficiary is not liable to income tax on payments of the pension advice allowance made in respect of them.</p><sup>98</sup><h3>Small lump sums and also genuine errors</h3><sup>99</sup><p>The Registered Pension Schemes (Authorised Payments) Regulations 2009 - SI 2009/1171</p><sup>100</sup><p>These regulations set out two broad categories of authorised payments to, or in respect of a member. They also provide for how the payments will be taxed.</p><sup>101</sup><p>The first category is certain small lump sum payments that can be paid outside the usual conditions for a trivial commutation lump sum (see</p><sup>102</sup><p>The other category of payment authorises pension or lump sum payments made in cases involving certain errors, including some related arrear payments, all of which would otherwise be unauthorised. The payments covered will typically arise in unanticipated or obligatory circumstances - see</p><sup>103</sup><p>Genuine errors that are not benefits covered by these regulations are described from</p></div></div></body></html>
