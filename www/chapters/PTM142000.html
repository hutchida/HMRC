Because of the difference between how obligations can arise under scheme rules and when the tax rules recognise an actual entitlement to the payment of pension (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM062800:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM062800</remotelink>), specific provision was made in SI2006/614&#160;to make arrear payments of scheme pensions &#8216;authorised payments&#8217;&#160;under the tax rules.</p><p>This issue only really affected scheme pensions, since money purchase pots would&#160;be likely to continue to grow during any delay, and a lifetime annuity that starts later would usually pay a higher level of pension than would have been paid had the annuity begun on time - whereas for defined benefit rights, factoring in increases was not always possible, as the member&#8217;s pension level was set by the scheme rules.</p><p>These regulations operate so the payment of arrears of scheme pension which have accrued, to which the member is entitled at the time when the pension begins to be paid and which is taxable pension income within the meaning of section 579B Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 is an authorised member payment.</p><p>The payment must not exceed the amount accrued during the period ending with the date on which the member became entitled to the pension (&#8220;the actual start date&#8221;) and beginning with the earliest date from which the member could, at the actual start date, have required the scheme administrator, in accordance with the rules of the scheme, to make a payment of arrears of pension.</p><p>For cases where the member has died before becoming actually entitled (according to the tax rules) to the arrear, see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM062800:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM062800</remotelink>.</p><p>Although as stated above a lifetime annuity that starts later than the date when it could have started under the scheme rules will usually pay a higher level of pension, due to the pot being larger than it was at the time it could have started, arrears of lifetime annuity income can also be paid as authorised pension in certain circumstances.&#160;Some annuity providers will offer an annuity contract allowing payments to be paid to the member in respect of a period before the annuity was set up, backdated to the date from which that member&#160;had the right to be paid a pension under the scheme rules.</p><p>Where an amount of arrears in respect of a period before the contract was set up was paid at the time the annuity started (and where the annuity entitlement arose before 6 April 2015), we would not consider that the &#8216;amount of the annuity&#8217; had decreased, if the periodic amount paid in respect of the earlier period was paid at the same rate pro rata as the payments to be made going forward.</p><p>This is because for an annuity where the entitlement arose before 6 April 2015, it was a requirement for the annuity to qualify as a lifetime annuity that the amount of the annuity must not decrease.&#160;That condition does not apply for annuities where the entitlement arises on or after 6 April 2015.&#160;In either case, the entitlement to the lifetime annuity still arises when all the necessary steps have been taken as described on page <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM088200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM088200</remotelink>, and the entitlement to the pension commencement lump sum for tax purposes therefore still arises immediately before that time, with the window for paying the authorised pension commencement lump sum extending six months before and twelve months after the date of entitlement for tax purposes.</p><p>As the annuity payments paid late are considered to be authorised under section 165 FA 2004, there is no need to make provision in secondary legislation to authorise them.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM142000:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Contracted-out rights earned between 1961 and 1975 and restoring state pension scheme rights</h3><p>The Registered Pension Schemes (Authorised Payments) Regulations 2006 - SI 2006/209</p><p>The payment of lump sums representing commuted equivalent pension benefits (contracted-out rights earned between 1961 and 1975) is also an authorised payment providing the payment is made in accordance with the relevant DWP legislation (as described in regulation 2(a) of The Registered Pension Schemes (Authorised Payments) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/209).

Regulated financial advice means advice in respect of the person&#8217;s financial position, including their pension arrangements and the use of their pension funds. HMRC is satisfied that this includes advice on how to use assets to fund care in old age, advice on whether in retirement the person will need to access sources of income other than their pension savings (for example, by equity release from their home), and advice on how to draw an income for retirement from all their pension pots and their stocks and shares ISA, but does not include inheritance tax planning or advice solely on an investment fund that will not be used for retirement income.</p><h3>Regulated financial advice</h3><p>Regulated financial advice means advice covered by Article 53 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 - SI 2001/544.</p><h3>Amount of payment</h3><p>The amount of each payment must not exceed &#163;500. Only one payment in respect of a person may be made in a tax year, and only three in the person&#8217;s lifetime. This means that if advice costing &#163;375 in respect of a person is paid for using this allowance in a tax year, no further payment may be made until the following tax year at the earliest. There is no facility to carry forward any unused allowance, nor to make two payments in respect of the same person in the same tax year even if they total no more than &#163;500.</p><h3>Taxation of the pension advice allowance</h3><p>The member or beneficiary is not liable to income tax on payments of the pension advice allowance made in respect of them.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM142000:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Small lump sums and also genuine errors</h3><p>The Registered Pension Schemes (Authorised Payments) Regulations 2009 - SI 2009/1171</p><p>These regulations set out two broad categories of authorised payments to, or in respect of a member.

Because of the difference between how obligations can arise under scheme rules and when the tax rules recognise an actual entitlement to the payment of pension (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM062800:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM062800</remotelink>), specific provision was made in SI2006/614&#160;to make arrear payments of scheme pensions &#8216;authorised payments&#8217;&#160;under the tax rules.</p><p>This issue only really affected scheme pensions, since money purchase pots would&#160;be likely to continue to grow during any delay, and a lifetime annuity that starts later would usually pay a higher level of pension than would have been paid had the annuity begun on time - whereas for defined benefit rights, factoring in increases was not always possible, as the member&#8217;s pension level was set by the scheme rules.</p><p>These regulations operate so the payment of arrears of scheme pension which have accrued, to which the member is entitled at the time when the pension begins to be paid and which is taxable pension income within the meaning of section 579B Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 is an authorised member payment.</p><p>The payment must not exceed the amount accrued during the period ending with the date on which the member became entitled to the pension (&#8220;the actual start date&#8221;) and beginning with the earliest date from which the member could, at the actual start date, have required the scheme administrator, in accordance with the rules of the scheme, to make a payment of arrears of pension.</p><p>For cases where the member has died before becoming actually entitled (according to the tax rules) to the arrear, see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM062800:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM062800</remotelink>.</p><p>Although as stated above a lifetime annuity that starts later than the date when it could have started under the scheme rules will usually pay a higher level of pension, due to the pot being larger than it was at the time it could have started, arrears of lifetime annuity income can also be paid as authorised pension in certain circumstances.&#160;Some annuity providers will offer an annuity contract allowing payments to be paid to the member in respect of a period before the annuity was set up, backdated to the date from which that member&#160;had the right to be paid a pension under the scheme rules.</p><p>Where an amount of arrears in respect of a period before the contract was set up was paid at the time the annuity started (and where the annuity entitlement arose before 6 April 2015), we would not consider that the &#8216;amount of the annuity&#8217; had decreased, if the periodic amount paid in respect of the earlier period was paid at the same rate pro rata as the payments to be made going forward.</p><p>This is because for an annuity where the entitlement arose before 6 April 2015, it was a requirement for the annuity to qualify as a lifetime annuity that the amount of the annuity must not decrease.&#160;That condition does not apply for annuities where the entitlement arises on or after 6 April 2015.&#160;In either case, the entitlement to the lifetime annuity still arises when all the necessary steps have been taken as described on page <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM088200</remotelink>, and the entitlement to the pension commencement lump sum for tax purposes therefore still arises immediately before that time, with the window for paying the authorised pension commencement lump sum extending six months before and twelve months after the date of entitlement for tax purposes.</p><p>As the annuity payments paid late are considered to be authorised under section 165 FA 2004, there is no need to make provision in secondary legislation to authorise them.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM142000:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Contracted-out rights earned between 1961 and 1975 and restoring state pension scheme rights</h3><p>The Registered Pension Schemes (Authorised Payments) Regulations 2006 - SI 2006/209</p><p>The payment of lump sums representing commuted equivalent pension benefits (contracted-out rights earned between 1961 and 1975) is also an authorised payment providing the payment is made in accordance with the relevant DWP legislation (as described in regulation 2(a) of The Registered Pension Schemes (Authorised Payments) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/209).

Regulated financial advice means advice in respect of the person&#8217;s financial position, including their pension arrangements and the use of their pension funds. HMRC is satisfied that this includes advice on how to use assets to fund care in old age, advice on whether in retirement the person will need to access sources of income other than their pension savings (for example, by equity release from their home), and advice on how to draw an income for retirement from all their pension pots and their stocks and shares ISA, but does not include inheritance tax planning or advice solely on an investment fund that will not be used for retirement income.</p><h3>Regulated financial advice</h3><p>Regulated financial advice means advice covered by Article 53 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 - SI 2001/544.</p><h3>Amount of payment</h3><p>The amount of each payment must not exceed &#163;500. Only one payment in respect of a person may be made in a tax year, and only three in the person&#8217;s lifetime. This means that if advice costing &#163;375 in respect of a person is paid for using this allowance in a tax year, no further payment may be made until the following tax year at the earliest. There is no facility to carry forward any unused allowance, nor to make two payments in respect of the same person in the same tax year even if they total no more than &#163;500.</p><h3>Taxation of the pension advice allowance</h3><p>The member or beneficiary is not liable to income tax on payments of the pension advice allowance made in respect of them.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM142000:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Small lump sums and also genuine errors</h3><p>The Registered Pension Schemes (Authorised Payments) Regulations 2009 - SI 2009/1171</p><p>These regulations set out two broad categories of authorised payments to, or in respect of a member.
