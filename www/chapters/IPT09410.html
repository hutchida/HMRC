In summary, the new Tribunal structure consists of a First-tier Tribunal and an Upper Tribunal. IPT appeals will normally be heard by the First-tier Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal will hear appeals against decisions made by the First-tier Tribunal (currently heard by the High Court). Appeals from the Upper Tribunal will be heard by the Court of Appeal or the Court of Sessions in Scotland.</p><p>At the same time, the way in which we deal with appeals internally also changed. A formal review process was introduced to many direct and indirect taxes, for the first time. While the review process already exists in IPT, under the new procedure it became optional. This means that an insurer or anyone affected by an appealable decision involving IPT will be able to appeal directly to the Tribunal without having to go through the review process beforehand. Once they receive a decision letter, tax payers will have 30 days in which to decide whether to ask for a review or to appeal directly to the Tribunal. The time limits for conducting reviews and notifying decisions remain unchanged. Sections 59 and 60 of the FA 1994 have been amended to reflect the changes. While the review process becomes optional, it is still preferable that we first try and deal with any disputes without recourse to the Tribunal wherever possible. New guidance has been published - <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_APPEALS-REVIEWS-AND-TRIBUNALS-GUIDANCE:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">Appeals, Reviews and Tribunals guidance (ARTG)</remotelink>.
