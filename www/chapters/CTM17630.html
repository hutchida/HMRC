This definition covers not just a conventional dealer who holds shares as trading stock. It also covers banks and certain other financial concerns. If such a concern would include a profit on a sale of the shares in its trading profits then it will be a dealer in relation to those shares. This was confirmed in Bibby v Prudential Assurance Ltd / Oakes v Equitable Life Assurance Society (2001) 73TC235.

Insurance companies were excluded from the definition of dealer for distributions made on or after 2 July 1997. The current legislation is at CTA09/S130 as amended by FA09/SCH14.
