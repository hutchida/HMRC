This definition covers not just a conventional dealer who holds shares as trading stock. It also covers banks and certain other financial concerns. If such a concern would include a profit on a sale of the shares in its trading profits then it will be a dealer in relation to those shares. This was confirmed in Bibby v Prudential Assurance Ltd / Oakes v Equitable Life Assurance Society (2001) 73TC235. Further guidance on the treatment of distributions received by banks and other financial concerns is available in the Corporate Finance Manual.</p><h3>Insurance companies</h3><p>An insurance company could be a dealer for distributions made before 2 July 1997 if it satisfied all the conditions in ICTA88/S95 (1). Insurance companies were excluded from the definition of dealer for distributions made on or after 2 July 1997. The current legislation is at CTA09/S130 as amended by FA09/SCH14. Further guidance on the treatment of distributions received by insurance companies is available in the Life Assurance Manual and in the General Insurance Manual.</p><h3>Purchase of shares</h3><p>This includes not only a reference to the redemption or repayment of shares.
