His personal representatives are Smith &amp; Partners. John had been a member of three registered pension schemes in his lifetime.</p><p>John was taking all his benefits from scheme A as flexi-access drawdown pension, and from scheme B as a scheme pension. John has taken no benefits from scheme C.</p><p>The funds remaining in scheme A are used to provide John&#8217;s son with a flexi-access drawdown fund lump sum death benefit. Scheme B provides Mary with a dependants&#8217; scheme pension. As neither of these death benefits are within BCE 5C, BCE 5D&#160;or BCE 7, they do not affect the lifetime allowance position following John&#8217;s death.</p><p>Scheme C pays Mary a &#163;395,000 defined benefit lump sum death benefit on 9 November 2015. This is a relevant lump sum death benefit falling within BCE 7. Scheme C tells Mary that there is a possibility that she will become liable to a lifetime allowance charge on the payment.</p><p>Step 1</p><p>Before 9 February 2016 (the 3 month deadline) the scheme C administrator informs Smith &amp; Partners of the defined benefit lump sum death benefit payment, stating the amount and date of payment.</p><p>Step 2</p><p>As the amount is less than 50 per cent of the standard lifetime allowance for the 2015-16 tax year the scheme administrator does not have to make a report to HMRC.</p><p>Step 3</p><p>Smith &amp; Partners must now find out if a chargeable amount crystallised through BCE 7 following the payment of the defined benefits lump sum death benefit. If there is a chargeable amount they must report this to HMRC by 8 August 2016 (Step 4).</p><p>Smith &amp; Partners first need to find out how much John had crystallised previously in his lifetime at earlier BCEs, and whether or not he was entitled to an enhanced lifetime allowance. This will tell them how much of his lifetime allowance John had available when he died.</p><p>Every tax year John has been provided with a statement by the administrators of schemes A and B telling him how much of his lifetime allowance he had used up under these schemes at earlier BCEs. These statements enable Smith &amp; Partners to calculate John&#8217;s available lifetime allowance.</p><p>However, Smith &amp; Partners may not have these statements, or be unable to find them or be unsure that the certificates they hold are complete. They can therefore seek clarification from any of the administrators of schemes A, B and C of the amounts that have crystallised previously in respect of John under those schemes.</p><p>If John was entitled to an enhanced lifetime allowance he would have a certificate from HMRC confirming the lifetime allowance enhancement factor he was entitled to. John was not entitled to an enhanced lifetime allowance, but if they wish Smith &amp; Partners can ask the scheme administrators whether John relied on an entitlement to an enhanced lifetime allowance at any of the BCEs that occurred under their schemes.</p><p>Smith &amp; Partners are not convinced they have all John&#8217;s statements to hand so write to the administrators of scheme A, B and C. The schemes have 3 months to respond.</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Scheme A says John had used up 50 per cent of the standard lifetime allowance under their scheme. (This related to a pension commencement lump sum and designation to drawdown during John&#8217;s lifetime).</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Scheme B says John had used up 40 per cent of the standard lifetime allowance under their scheme. (This related to a pension commencement lump sum and the scheme pension).</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Scheme C says John had used up no lifetime allowance under their scheme prior to the payment of the defined benefit lump sum death benefit.</p></li><p>Smith &amp; Partners now know that John had used up 90 per cent of the standard lifetime allowance (his lifetime allowance entitlement) when he died. So he had 10 per cent available. This equates to &#163;125,000 at the effective date of BCE 7, when the standard lifetime allowance is &#163;1.25 million. They therefore calculate that a chargeable amount of &#163;270,000 crystallised through BCE 7 in relation to the &#163;395,000 defined benefit lump sum death benefit paid.</p><p>Step 4</p><p>Smith &amp; Partners report the chargeable amount to HMRC, giving details of the scheme that paid the triggering lump sum death benefit, John&#8217;s name, the date of payment and the amount of the payment. They must do this by 8 August 2016 (within 13 months of John&#8217;s death).</p><p>Step 5</p><p>HMRC write to the administrator of scheme C asking for full details of the recipient(s) of the &#163;395,000 lump sum payment and confirmation of the amount paid and date of payment. The scheme administrator has 2 months to respond.</p><p>They provide HMRC with the details in that timescale.</p><p>Step 6</p><p>HMRC will assess Mary for the &#163;148,500 lifetime allowance charge due (55 per cent of the chargeable amount of &#163;270,000).</p><p>Mary has 30 days from the date of the assessment to account for the due charge.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM088400:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM088600:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>&#160;</p><table colsep="0" frame="none" pgwide="1" rowsep="0"><tgroup cols="2" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><colspec colname="C1" colnum="1" colsep="0" colwidth="50%" rowsep="0" /><colspec colname="C2" colnum="2" colsep="0" colwidth="50%" rowsep="0" /><tbody><tr rowsep="0"><td align="left" valign="top">Glossary</td><td align="left" valign="top"><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM000001:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM000001</remotelink></td></tr><tr rowsep="0"><td align="left" valign="top">&#160;</td><td align="left" valign="top">&#160;</td></tr></tbody></tgroup></table><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088500:MANUAL-PARA_IDAKMLSG:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Who must perform the lifetime allowance test for a BCE after the member has died?</remotelink>&#160;<nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088500:MANUAL-PARA_IDAVQLSG:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Reporting requirements for a BCE 5C, BCE 5D&#160;or BCE 7 following the member&#8217;s death</remotelink>&#160;<nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088500:MANUAL-PARA_IDAWRLSG:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Summary of the steps that should be followed</remotelink>&#160;<nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088500:MANUAL-PARA_IDA4TLSG:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Step 1: actions the scheme administrator must take - personal representatives</remotelink>&#160;<nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088500:MANUAL-PARA_IDA2VLSG:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Step 2: reporting actions the scheme administrator must take - HMRC (for BCE 7 only)</remotelink>&#160;<nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088500:MANUAL-PARA_IDABXLSG:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Step 3: actions the personal representatives must take</remotelink>&#160;<nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088500:MANUAL-PARA_IDAX3LSG:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Step 4: reporting actions the individual&#8217;s personal representatives must take</remotelink>&#160;<nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088500:MANUAL-PARA_IDA45LSG:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Step 5: HMRC asks the administrator for information</remotelink>&#160;<nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088500:MANUAL-PARA_IDAPBMSG:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Step 6: HMRC assesses any lifetime allowance charge</remotelink>&#160;<nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088500:MANUAL-PARA_IDA3BMSG:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Worked example</remotelink></p><p>&#160;</p><h3>Who must perform the lifetime allowance test for a BCE after the member has died?</h3><p>Sections 206, 217(2) and (2A) and 219(7) Finance Act 2004</p><p>The Registered Pension Schemes (Provision of Information) Regulations 2006 - SI2006/567</p><h3>BCE 5C, BCE 5D&#160;and BCE 7</h3><p>BCE 5C, BCE 5D&#160;and BCE 7 are relevant post-death benefit crystallisation events (BCEs).</p><p>For more information on:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>BCE 5C and BCE 5D&#160;- see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088660:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM088660</remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>BCE 7 - see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088680:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM088680</remotelink>.</p></li><p>Where a relevant post-death BCE occurs following the death of a scheme member, the scheme administrator of the scheme in which the BCE arises is not responsible for testing whether or not that individual had sufficient available lifetime allowance to cover the amount crystallising at that BCE.

His personal representatives are Smith &amp; Partners. John had been a member of three registered pension schemes in his lifetime.</p><p>John was taking all his benefits from scheme A as flexi-access drawdown pension, and from scheme B as a scheme pension. John has taken no benefits from scheme C.</p><p>The funds remaining in scheme A are used to provide John&#8217;s son with a flexi-access drawdown fund lump sum death benefit. Scheme B provides Mary with a dependants&#8217; scheme pension. As neither of these death benefits are within BCE 5C, BCE 5D&#160;or BCE 7, they do not affect the lifetime allowance position following John&#8217;s death.</p><p>Scheme C pays Mary a &#163;395,000 defined benefit lump sum death benefit on 9 November 2015. This is a relevant lump sum death benefit falling within BCE 7. Scheme C tells Mary that there is a possibility that she will become liable to a lifetime allowance charge on the payment.</p><p>Step 1</p><p>Before 9 February 2016 (the 3 month deadline) the scheme C administrator informs Smith &amp; Partners of the defined benefit lump sum death benefit payment, stating the amount and date of payment.</p><p>Step 2</p><p>As the amount is less than 50 per cent of the standard lifetime allowance for the 2015-16 tax year the scheme administrator does not have to make a report to HMRC.</p><p>Step 3</p><p>Smith &amp; Partners must now find out if a chargeable amount crystallised through BCE 7 following the payment of the defined benefits lump sum death benefit. If there is a chargeable amount they must report this to HMRC by 8 August 2016 (Step 4).</p><p>Smith &amp; Partners first need to find out how much John had crystallised previously in his lifetime at earlier BCEs, and whether or not he was entitled to an enhanced lifetime allowance. This will tell them how much of his lifetime allowance John had available when he died.</p><p>Every tax year John has been provided with a statement by the administrators of schemes A and B telling him how much of his lifetime allowance he had used up under these schemes at earlier BCEs. These statements enable Smith &amp; Partners to calculate John&#8217;s available lifetime allowance.</p><p>However, Smith &amp; Partners may not have these statements, or be unable to find them or be unsure that the certificates they hold are complete. They can therefore seek clarification from any of the administrators of schemes A, B and C of the amounts that have crystallised previously in respect of John under those schemes.</p><p>If John was entitled to an enhanced lifetime allowance he would have a certificate from HMRC confirming the lifetime allowance enhancement factor he was entitled to. John was not entitled to an enhanced lifetime allowance, but if they wish Smith &amp; Partners can ask the scheme administrators whether John relied on an entitlement to an enhanced lifetime allowance at any of the BCEs that occurred under their schemes.</p><p>Smith &amp; Partners are not convinced they have all John&#8217;s statements to hand so write to the administrators of scheme A, B and C. The schemes have 3 months to respond.</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Scheme A says John had used up 50 per cent of the standard lifetime allowance under their scheme. (This related to a pension commencement lump sum and designation to drawdown during John&#8217;s lifetime).</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Scheme B says John had used up 40 per cent of the standard lifetime allowance under their scheme. (This related to a pension commencement lump sum and the scheme pension).</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>Scheme C says John had used up no lifetime allowance under their scheme prior to the payment of the defined benefit lump sum death benefit.</p></li><p>Smith &amp; Partners now know that John had used up 90 per cent of the standard lifetime allowance (his lifetime allowance entitlement) when he died. So he had 10 per cent available. This equates to &#163;125,000 at the effective date of BCE 7, when the standard lifetime allowance is &#163;1.25 million. They therefore calculate that a chargeable amount of &#163;270,000 crystallised through BCE 7 in relation to the &#163;395,000 defined benefit lump sum death benefit paid.</p><p>Step 4</p><p>Smith &amp; Partners report the chargeable amount to HMRC, giving details of the scheme that paid the triggering lump sum death benefit, John&#8217;s name, the date of payment and the amount of the payment. They must do this by 8 August 2016 (within 13 months of John&#8217;s death).</p><p>Step 5</p><p>HMRC write to the administrator of scheme C asking for full details of the recipient(s) of the &#163;395,000 lump sum payment and confirmation of the amount paid and date of payment. The scheme administrator has 2 months to respond.</p><p>They provide HMRC with the details in that timescale.</p><p>Step 6</p><p>HMRC will assess Mary for the &#163;148,500 lifetime allowance charge due (55 per cent of the chargeable amount of &#163;270,000).</p><p>Mary has 30 days from the date of the assessment to account for the due charge.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088400:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM088600:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div></div></body></html>
