Prior to the introduction of income tax Self Assessment (ITSA), there was no difference in procedure when dealing with</p><sup>2</sup><p>an application for relief at source from UK income tax on future payments of income, or</p><sup>3</sup><p>a claim to repayment of UK income tax that had already been deducted.</p><sup>4</sup><p>But when the system of Self Assessment (SA) was introduced for UK income tax years from 1996/97, claims to repayment of income tax and claims to payment of tax credit became subject to the SA rules. We therefore need to differentiate between an application and a claim because the SA rules must be followed in all cases where a claim is received. Applications are not subject to the SA rules.</p><sup>5</sup><p>The DT forms are dual-purpose, in that they permit a customer to make an application, a claim or a combination of both, on the same form. INTM331025 explains that a combined application and claim must be dealt with under the SA procedures.</p><sup>6</sup><p>The SA procedures for dealing with claims are explained at INTM331000.</p><sup>7</sup><p> Previous page</p></div></body></html>
