Such schemes result in income escaping the charge to tax </p><p>and</p><p>* Schemes that use capital losses to cover a capital gain, and as part of the arrangements there is a related deduction from income profits. These schemes result in a reduction in the amount of corporation tax payable on income profits. </p><li><lilabel>1</lilabel><p>The new rules will apply where the following conditions are met</p></li><p>* There is a receipt which but for the arrangements would have been treated as income for the purposes of CT * A chargeable gain accrues to a company in respect of the receipt * There are capital losses which are available to be set against the gain * The main purpose or one of the main purposes of the arrangements was to obtain a tax advantage </p><p>or</p><p>* A chargeable gain accrues to a company * And a company incurs expenditure which is allowable as a deduction in computing its income profits for the purposes of CT * There is a capital loss available to be set against the capital gain * The main purpose or one of the main purposes of the arrangements was to obtain a tax advantage </p><li><lilabel>1</lilabel><p>Where the conditions are met and HMRC issues a notice then the company is denied the use of capital losses against the gain. The gain will therefore remain within the charge to corporation tax.</p></li><li><lilabel>2</lilabel><p>This rule applies to chargeable gains accruing on any disposal made on or after 5 December 2005.</p></li><li><lilabel>3</lilabel><p>In order to ensure that the provisions are targeted only at abusive transactions, they apply a purpose test to the arrangements, so that only those designed to achieve a tax advantage are within their scope.</p></li><li><lilabel>4</lilabel><p>Transactions which have a commercial, not tax motivated purpose, such as sale and leaseback arrangements should not be caught. However to provide extra certainty for these common types of financing arrangements there is an explicit exclusion for the sale and leaseback of land and property, where the transactions are with third parties.</p></li><li><lilabel>5</lilabel><p>HMRC will consider requests for informal advice about the application of this third TAAR to specific cases. Requests should be made in the format detailed in draft guidance. Provided that all relevant facts are disclosed to the clearance officer, HMRC will be bound by the advice they give.</p></li><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_CG-APP4:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_CG-APP9:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div></div></body></html>
