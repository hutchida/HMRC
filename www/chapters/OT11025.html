While the bulk of such expenditure will be of a capital nature, it is not a requirement of the legislation; the terms are not interchangeable.</p><h3>Development of Legislation</h3><p>When OTA75 was enacted, the special rules concerning long-term assets were contained in OTA75\\S4.

On some of the larger second generation fields extra equipment was added (e.g. pumping, processing, pipeline &#8216;T-joints&#8217;) to facilitate future use by known or projected other prospects. Additionally, as mature fields went into production decline, it made economic sense to have new fields tie into existing facilities to take up any spare capacity.</p><p>Because the &#8216;old rules&#8217; were not adequately designed to deal with such arrangements, in particular shared use and tariffing (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT15100:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT15100</remotelink>), the department entered into a consultative process with the oil industry which culminated in their substantial amendment and extension of the rules by OTA83.
