These ‘old rules’ were designed to provide a framework for dealing with what is now the first generation of North Sea oil developments, which at the time were largely expected to be self-contained.</p><sup>9</sup><p>But as time elapsed and more fields came on stream, it became apparent that many smaller prospects could only be developed commercially as satellites of existing fields sharing some of their facilities. On some of the larger second generation fields extra equipment was added (e.g. pumping, processing, pipeline ‘T-joints’) to facilitate future use by known or projected other prospects. Additionally, as mature fields went into production decline, it made economic sense to have new fields tie into existing facilities to take up any spare capacity.</p><sup>10</sup><p>Because the ‘old rules’ were not adequately designed to deal with such arrangements, in particular shared use and tariffing (see OT15100), the department entered into a consultative process with the oil industry which culminated in their substantial amendment and extension of the rules by OTA83.
