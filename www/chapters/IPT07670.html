The tax point for the tax on the AP (£750) is the date on which the additional premium is entered in the insurer’s records (Regulation 24(3)). Because the de minimis arrangements are an ESC, they do not completely tie in with the IPT Regulations, and there are no provisions that allow the tax point for the tax on the initial premium to be the date of entry of the additional premium. However, in cases such as this, it is acceptable for the insurer to bring to account the tax on the initial premium at the same time as the tax on the additional premium. If they do not, and the tax relating to the initial premium is assessed, then the legal tax point should be used to determine the accounting period assessed (the legal tax point being the date “as at which” the initial premium was due).
