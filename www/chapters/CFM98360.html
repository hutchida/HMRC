These in turn are based on the amounts brought into account for the purposes of corporation tax in the tax return and computations of individual companies.</p><sup>2</sup><p>However, there are two specific exceptions that apply on transition to the rules where the amounts relate to changes in accounting and tax prior to 1 April 2017:</p><sup>3</sup><p>The first exception applies where there has been a change of accounting policy and the period in which the new accounting policy applies, referred as at the later period, started before 1 April 2017. In this case the debits or credits brought into account under the Change of Accounting Practice Regulations 2004 (S.I. 2004/3271) in respect of that change of accounting policy are ignored for Corporate Interest Restriction purposes.</p><sup>4</sup><p>The second exception applies to ignore transitional adjustments arising from F(No.2)A15/Sch7 that are being brought into account under Para115/116 (transitional adjustments relating to loan relationships) or Para119/120 (transitional adjustments relating to derivative contracts).</p><sup>5</sup><p>These amounts are not therefore included as tax-interest or tax-EBITDA amounts under the regime.</p><sup>6</sup><p>Likewise, these amounts would not be included as group-interest and group-EBITDA (relevant in respect of {changes in accounting} where an alternative calculation election has been made).</p><sup>7</sup><p> Previous page</p></div></body></html>
