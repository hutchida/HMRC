Its only income is the dividends receivable as a result of its holding these shares.</p><sup>7</sup><p>Company C has two assets. One, a waste plant, has been constructed as a result of a contract with a local authority to collect and process household waste – the capacity of this plant is limited to the waste it has to collect under this contract. The second, a brick factory, has been constructed by C such that it can seek out alternative commercial contracts.</p><sup>8</sup><p>In isolation, Company C would fail the public infrastructure income and assets test in the twelve month accounting period ending 31 December 2019, on the basis that its commercial manufacturing operations form approximately 10% of its income and assets for that period.</p><sup>9</sup><p>Company B would pass these same tests for that period, on the basis all of its income and assets derive from shares in qualifying infrastructure companies.</p><sup>10</sup><p>However, if both Company B and Company C made elections to be qualifying companies, and they make a joint infrastructure election, both could pass the public infrastructure income and asset tests. Company C’s income and assets from its commercial manufacturing operations would be insignificant relative to Company B and its subsidiaries.</p><sup>11</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>12</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
