These will be CIS deductions that are not recorded on the contractor’s monthly return and the individuals to whom they relate will not have been identified as registered subcontractors during the period of enquiry. If, after this time a subcontractor (as described above) claims to have suffered CIS deductions from the scheme it may be possible (after completing the normal enquiries) to allocate specific amounts from the unallocated sum to the subcontractor.

The effect is that although the return will have been issued to the scheme a completed return will not be expected for that monthly period. See</p><sup>12</sup><p>Penalty Inhibitions - If ‘Yes’, a penalty inhibition has been set (during the period of settlement) which will prevent the issue of all new automatic filing penalties for the period inhibited. Inhibitions are mostly used when HMRC are advised that the contractor is unable to submit the return by the due date - but the return is still expected in due course.
