For any subsequent accounting period the QIS will need to satisfy the GDO conditions set out in regulation 9A SI2006/964 (as inserted by SI2009/2036). For example if an existing QIS has a 12 month AP that begins on the 1 February 2008, then it will be deemed to meet the GDO from the 1 January 2009 till the 31 January 2010. Therefore, from the 1 February 2010, the fund must meet the general GDO (see CTM48155). However, it will be able to use the clearance provisions in regulation 9B during this period of grace to determine whether the fund documents have been adequately amended to fulfil the GDO. In this example, and taking into account the timetable for clearances, an application for clearance would need to be made by 30 November 2010.</p><p>If an existing QIS does not fulfil the GDO after the end of the first AP beginning on or after the 1 January 2009, then the QIS will be treated as a close investment holding company from the beginning of the following AP and the tax consequences are explained in CTM48720.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM48715:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Transitional arrangements for substantial holders</h3><p>Where a QIS is established before the 1 January 2009 and has substantial holders (CTM48730), then these investors will have been required to calculate the change in &#8216;market value&#8217; of their holdings between the last pair of adjacent measuring dates. However, under regulation 31 SI2008/3159 a final measuring date of the 31 December 2008 was added to regulation 56 SI2006/964. This means that a substantial holder will need to fair value their holdings the last measuring date that was used under the substantial holding rules to the 31 December 2008.
