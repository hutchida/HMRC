Where the broker is able to match a willing buyer and seller from his own client pool, there will be no movement of shares as the securities will remain in the name of the participant. The participant will use the code OAT to indicate that whilst there is a agreement to transfer chargeable securities (between his clients) and upon which an SDRT charge may arise, there is no other CREST counterparty involved.
