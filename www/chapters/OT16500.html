Were the normal transfer rules to apply, FA80\Sch17\Para15 (see OT18130) would operate.

It could therefore claim the loss as a UFL in another field in which it had paid PRT and thereby secure a repayment.</p><sup>4</sup><p>The loophole could also be exploited by a similar opt out transfer earlier in field life before a participator had broken even in the field. The opt out would enable it to crystallise its unused loss and claim it as a UFL when the field permanently ceased production.
