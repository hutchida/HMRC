It also causes further problems if SCI need to make a jeopardy amendment or close the enquiry with COTAX.</p><sup>2</sup><p>When you transfer the case, leave the MAPS ‘enquiry ended date’ field blank. This preserves the COTAX record as an open enquiry until SCI formally close it.</p><sup>3</sup><p>See:</p><sup>4</sup><p>COM71021 for a list of forms relevant to this subject</p><sup>5</sup><p>COM71011 for a list of functions to use in particular situations</p><sup>6</sup><p>COM71012 for legislation applying to this subject.</p><sup>7</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>8</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
