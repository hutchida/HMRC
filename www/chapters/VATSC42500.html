Hotels often describe these as “no-show charges”. They can fall into two categories, depending on the terms and conditions of the booking.</p><sup>1</sup><p>In the case of a normal reservation guarantee (see VATSC42300) this represents compensation for breach of contract and is outside the scope of VAT. Where a guaranteed room (see VATSC42300) has been held for the customer, the no-show charge is consideration for a supply of keeping a room available and is subject to VAT.</p><sup>2</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>3</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
