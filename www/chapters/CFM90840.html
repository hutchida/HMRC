IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires an entity to disclose in the income statement the net gains or losses on particular financial assets, financial liabilities, investments, and loans and receivables. The buying and selling of financial instruments is reported by reference to the margins made, not on the absolute sale value of those instruments. When the markets are volatile, a group may incur significant losses on the sale of these instruments.

In Example 1, the net trading income shows a profit and overall substantially all the trading income is derived from qualifying activities. The trading income is the total of the gross interest income £100,000, gross fee and commission income £5,000, net trading income £10,000 and other income £2,000. By contrast in Example 2, the net trading income shows a loss and overall the income from qualifying activities does not represent substantially all of the trading income. The trading income is the total of the gross interest income £100,000, gross fee and commission income £5,000, the net trading income (£40,000) and the other income £3,000.</p><sup>9</sup><p></p><sup>10</sup><p>Where the trading income condition is not met, solely because income that arises from an activity that is a qualifying activity and is reported on a net basis, shows a loss,TIOPA10/S266(1)(b) treats the worldwide group as a qualifying financial services group for the period of account of the worldwide group. There are no set criteria by which to judge whether a group satisfies this sub-section; it is up to the group to be able demonstrate that without the losses it would have met the trading income condition for a period of account.</p><sup>11</sup><p>The reference in S266 (1)(b) to financial statements prepared in accordance with IAS provides a common frame of reference for deciding whether particular income is reported on a net basis or not.
