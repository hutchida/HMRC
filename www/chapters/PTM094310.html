Insurance policies should be valued in accordance with this ABI protocol for the purposes of IP 2016.</p><sup>158</sup><p>Any questions about valuing insurance policies as at 5 April 2016 should be raised with the insurer providing the policy.</p><sup>159</sup><h4>Amount C - valuing uncrystallised rights under a cash balance arrangement</h4><sup>160</sup><p>Sections 212(4) and 277 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>161</sup><p>The value of uncrystallised rights on 5 April 2016 is the amount that would be available for the provision of immediate benefits if the member had been entitled to receive them on that day but subject to two valuation assumptions.</p><sup>162</sup><p>The two valuation assumptions are that:</p><sup>163</sup><p>the benefit should be calculated assuming, if the member has not already done so, that they have reached the age at which no reduction would apply under the scheme’s rules to the payment of an immediate benefit, and</p><sup>164</sup><p>they are deemed to be in good physical and mental health on 5 April 2016.</p><sup>165</sup><h4>Example</h4><sup>166</sup><p>Jordan has pension savings in a cash balance arrangement.
