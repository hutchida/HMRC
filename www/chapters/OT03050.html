In 1983 PRT was applied to tariff and disposal receipts arising from the use of field assets (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT15010:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT15010</remotelink>). But since 2004 tariffs relating to new business that are tax-exempt tariffing receipts (<remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT15810:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT15810</remotelink>) do not constitute chargeable tariffs for PRT purposes.</p><p>PRT is charged for six monthly periods ending on 30 June and 31 December.

Expenditure does not become allowable until LB Oil &amp; Gas gives formal notice that the expenditure has been allowed. The expenditure is then included in the next assessment to be made after the notice has been given, which may or may not be the assessment for the chargeable period in which the expenditure was incurred depending on the date when the expenditure is allowed. Field expenditure must normally be claimed by the Responsible Person (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT04030:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT04030</remotelink>) under OTA75\\SCH5 (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT04390:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT04390</remotelink>) and the claim must show how this is allocated between the participators.

Certain types of cost are however specifically excluded, e.g. interest and the cost of land (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT09000:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT09000</remotelink> for full details of the types of allowable expenditure and the exclusions). In general, there is no distinction between capital and revenue expenditure for PRT purposes; relief is available in full for most allowable expenditure as it is incurred.

The test for admissibility of long-term asset expenditure is one of use, or expected use, in connection with a field for a qualifying purpose. There are special PRT rules that relate to long term assets (for further details see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT11000:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT11000</remotelink>).</p><p>Certain categories of allowable expenditure may also qualify for Supplement (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT12000:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT12000</remotelink>). This is an additional relief, in the form of 35% of the allowable costs, which is available before the participator reaches a cumulative net profit position in the field (for details of qualifying expenditure see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT12050:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT12050</remotelink>).</p><p>As expenditure does not reduce a participator&#8217;s liability until it has been claimed and allowed the expenditure incurred in a particular period will not necessarily be set against the income for that period.
