There are therefore further rules to ensure that the group’s deductions for aggregate net tax-interest expense are never restricted below the de minimis amount.</p><sup>3</sup><p>These rules work by comparing:</p><sup>4</sup><p>the total disallowed amount of the group in the period calculated as if Chapter 8 applies (and therefore the de minimis is not available) – the ‘Chapter 8 amount’; and</p><sup>5</sup><p>the total disallowed amount of the group in the period calculated as if Chapter 8 was not applied, but interest capacity of the group was restricted to £2m i.e. the de minimis – the ‘ordinary amount’.</p><sup>6</sup><p>In an accounting period in which the Chapter 8 amount exceeds the ordinary amount, the rules in Chapter 8 are switched off and the interest capacity is taken to be the de-minimis amount.</p><sup>7</sup><p>However, from 1 January 2018, these rules do not apply to a worldwide group that has QIC (Q) that receives tax-interest income (that is not insignificant) from another QIC which is not in the same worldwide group as Q but which is a related party of Q. Where this applies the group must apply the infrastructure rules to Q.</p><sup>8</sup><h4>Example</h4><sup>9</sup><p>Company A and Company B are in a group together. Company B is a QIC.</p><sup>10</sup><p>Column ‘No Chapter 8’ reflects interest restriction which would arise if Company B had not made an election to be a QIC which had effect for the accounting period. Interest capacity of the group would be £3m, by reference to the fixed ratio method.</p><sup>11</sup><p>However, Company B is a QIC. The Chapter 8 amount for the group would therefore be £1.5m, as there is no tax-EBITDA in Company A to generate interest capacity and the de minimis is not available.</p><sup>12</sup><p>The ordinary amount would be £0.5m. As this is lower than the Chapter 8 amount, the interest capacity of the group will be £2m for this accounting period.</p><sup>13</sup><p>Application of the above exception is not considered a revocation, and as such a comparison of the Chapter 8 amount against the ordinary amount may be required accounting period on period.</p><sup>14</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>15</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
