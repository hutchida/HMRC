Otherwise, if settlors together make the settlement, the gains in such a case should be apportioned according to the amounts each put in. If a settlor adds to a settlement, then the amount put in should be compared with the value of the settlement at that time. Trust Offices should endeavour to reach a fair and easily worked solution.</p><sup>1</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>2</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
