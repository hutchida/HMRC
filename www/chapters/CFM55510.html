The issuer of a standard convertible security may ‘cash settle’ the conversion obligation. This may happen where issuing the full amount of shares would exceed the company’s authorised share capital, or where the terms of the security permit cash settlement in exceptional situations. If that happens, CTA09/S666 may allow the issuer to compute a one-off capital loss. That loss is equal to the excess, if any, of the amount paid to settle the option over its initial fair value.

Here you ignore S580(2) and (3).</p><sup>10</sup><p>Condition D: The company pays an amount in the AP to the creditor in discharge of any obligations under the debtor relationship. So here the issuer gives the holder cash instead of shares. There is no requirement for all of the obligations to be discharged in this way - the condition will be satisfied if holders receive shares plus cash.</p><sup>11</sup><p>Condition E: at the time when the company became a party to the debtor relationship it was not carrying on a banking business or a business as a securities house, or if it was carrying on such a business, it did not become a party to the debtor relationship in the ordinary course of that business.</p><sup>12</sup><p>Condition F: The company must not be an authorised unit trust, an investment trust, an open-ended investment company or a venture capital trust (these are ‘excluded bodies’ as defined under CTA09/S706).</p><sup>13</sup><p>This should not be confused with a case where the terms of the security permit cash settlement instead of physical delivery of shares, and as a result the issuer accounts for the security as a financial liability plus an embedded option.
