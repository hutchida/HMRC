This fits in with the intention to provide relief where major works are undertaken, rather than activities more akin to repairs. (Robert Sheldon, MP, said in the Committee Stage of the Oil Taxation Bill that operating costs were not allowable for supplement because they did not have inherent within them the same charges for interest that one has with capital expenditure (Hansard, Oil Taxation Bill 4 February 1975, page 536).)</p><sup>12</sup><p>OTA75\S3(5)(c) is concerned with both the production and transportation of oil, and the following references apply equally to transportation.</p><sup>13</sup><p>The LB Oil &amp; Gas view is that the comparison that should be made is between the rate of production that the field was capable of before the works were carried out, and the change in the rate of production that the works are expected to achieve. That the works do not achieve their aim is irrelevant. For example, if a field was producing 100,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd), and the works were intended to result in increasing that to 115,000 bopd, supplement would be due on those works. The increase in total field output would be more than 10%, and an increase of 15,000 bopd would in itself be substantial.
