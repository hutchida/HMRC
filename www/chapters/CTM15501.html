This applies without prejudice to CTA10/S1117 (6).</p><sup>7</sup><p>CTA10/S1117 (6) applies to securities that are not listed on a recognised stock exchange. The principal secured cannot exceed the issue price of the security except where the security is issued on terms reasonably comparable with the terms of issue of listed securities.</p><sup>8</sup><p>The issue price of a security may differ from the new consideration received by the issuer.

If a security is issued for new consideration of £100 but the principal secured is £20, neither CTA10/S1006 and CTA10/S1018 (1) nor CTA10/S1117 (6) will adjust the principal secured to the amount paid.
