CTA09/S931A charges distributions from UK and non-UK resident companies to corporation tax, but then exempts these from charge in most cases.

Applying the legislation to companies incorporated in foreign territories can be problematic since the relevant company law may be very different from UK company law. Following the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case of HMRC v First Nationwide [2012] EWCA Civ 278, HMRC’s view is that if a dividend payment is a distribution permitted in accordance with the law that governs the foreign company then in the absence of any evidence calling into question the legal form of the payment it will be treated as a dividend for the purposes of CTA10/S1000 (1) A, and</p><sup>12</sup><p>any other distribution out of the assets of the company made in respect of shares will be a distribution under CTA10/S1000 (1) B except to the extent that (a) the distribution represents repayment of capital on the shares, or (b) is equal in amount or value to any new consideration received by the company for the distribution.</p><sup>13</sup><p>For foreign companies, it may be unclear what capital on the shares consists of. The facts may vary between cases, but HMRC would normally expect to treat as a distribution an amount that:</p><sup>14</sup><p>is distributable in accordance with the relevant company law, and</p><sup>15</sup><p>is not made on winding up or as part of a procedure under the relevant company law for reducing share capital.</p><sup>16</sup><p>For the purposes of determining whether an amount is a repayment of capital on the shares, CTA10/S1027A treats a distribution out of a reserve</p><sup>17</sup><p>CTM15400</p><sup>18</sup><h3>Qualifying and non-qualifying distributions</h3><sup>19</sup><p>A qualifying distribution is any distribution within CTA10/S1000 or CTA10/S1064 (close companies - see CTM60500 onwards) except the following distributions which are non-qualifying distributions:</p><sup>20</sup><p>a distribution of bonus redeemable share capital, or</p><sup>21</sup><p>a distribution of bonus securities</p><sup>22</sup><p>which in relation to the company making it are distributions by virtue only of CTA10/S1000 (1) C or D - see CTM15450 and CTM20075.</p><sup>23</sup><p>Company A may make a distribution of bonus share capital or securities directly or indirectly to Company B.
