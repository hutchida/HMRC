As a field may have more than one development consent it will be “non-taxable” only if no part of the field had development consent on or before 16 March 1993. Thus, where a “taxable” field’s boundary is extended post-Budget to take in a new area; that area will become part of the “taxable” field (FA93\S185(1)(a) and FA93\S185(1)(b)).</p><sup>8</sup><h4>Unrecognised future fields</h4><sup>9</sup><p>A field that is determined after 16 March 1993 is not treated as “taxable” merely because a development decision for an earlier field also covered the then unrecognised future field (for example because it was below an earlier field determined in two dimensions)(FA93\S185(2)).</p><sup>10</sup><h4>Transmedian and foreign fields</h4><sup>11</sup><p>Transmedian Fields (defined in OT13450) are treated as wholly ‘non-taxable’ where the UK part is non-taxable (see OT03540).
