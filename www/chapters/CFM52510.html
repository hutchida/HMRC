The accounting concept of an embedded derivative is explained at CFM25030+, including guidance on when the derivative element is regarded as not being closely related to the host contract. Under IAS 39 or FRS 26, such embedded derivatives fall to be accounted for separately from the host contract: a technical term you may hear used for this is ‘bifurcation’.</p><sup>2</sup><p>You are most likely to encounter derivatives embedded in loan relationships - convertible and exchangeable securities are the most common example.
