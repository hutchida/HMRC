See Atherton v British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd 10TC155, reaffirmed and extended by the House of Lords in Granada Motorway Services Ltd v Tucker 53TC92. The Granada case confirmed that in principle expenditure on getting rid of a disadvantage may be capital expenditure in the same way as expenditure on acquiring an advantage. The case also confirmed that in principle, both tangible and intangible costs could be capital expenditure.
