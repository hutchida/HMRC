The legislation included the condition that HMRC had to approve an election and HMRC would only do so if evidence showed that there would be no assessable profits accruing to any participator in that field in future, or if there were, they would be fully covered by oil allowance. These rules required the provision of a substantial quantity of data to provide assurance to HMRC that there was no tax risk to the Exchequer before a field could be opted out of the PRT regime.</p><sup>2</sup><p>As PRT has been permanently zero-rated from 1 January 2016, there is no longer a requirement to have that assurance. As a result, HMRC introduced legislation at Autumn Statement 2016 for inclusion in FA 2017 to remove these conditions so that a field can be opted out through a simple election. This reduced administration for participators wishing to opt out fields from the PRT regime. An election is irrevocable.</p><sup>3</sup><p>This has effect from 23 November 2016, meaning fields can be opted out of PRT for the chargeable period beginning 1 January 2017. The legislation will become law through its inclusion in FA 2017, applying retrospectively. HMRC will use its collection and management powers to allow the responsible person to notify HMRC of an election from 23 November 2016.</p><sup>4</sup><p>The technical note on elections for fields to become non-taxable can be found here. The technical note was published on 23rd November 2016 to provide clarity and greater detail on the changes to elections to opt fields out and changes to returns, made at Autumn Statement 2016.</p><sup>5</sup><h3>How the legislation works</h3><sup>6</sup><p>Legislation published at Autumn Statement 2016 alters the legislation governing the rules for opting fields out of PRT. It amends Schedule 20B of FA 1993. This legislation has effect from 23 November 2016 through HMRC’s use of its collection and management powers.</p><sup>7</sup><p>The ability to opt out and for a field to become non- taxable was introduced by Section 107 of FA 2008, which created a new category of non-taxable field (</p><sup>8</sup><p>The following paragraphs outline how the legislation works - paragraph references are to those of revised Schedule 20B.</p><sup>9</sup><p>Paragraph 1: The responsible person (</p><sup>10</sup><p>Paragraph 2: The election must be made in writing.</p><sup>11</sup><p>Paragraph 3: The responsible person must notify the Commissioners (HMRC) that an election has been made.

It is important for HMRC to be able to continue to collect this data, as it is necessary for HMRC to be able to make accurate valuations for non-arm’s length sales of Category 2 oils. Accurate valuations benefit both HMRC and participators, and industry representatives have recognised this. As a result, at HMRC-industry working groups, industry representatives said that they would be willing to continue to provide this data on a voluntary basis.</p><sup>21</sup><h3>Tariff Receipts</h3><sup>22</sup><p>While making a field non-taxable will have no tax consequences for the field itself, there would be implications on the assessment of tariff receipts in the hands of an asset owner on tariffs paid by such a non-taxable field.</p><sup>23</sup><p>Therefore paragraph 4 in Part 2 of Schedule 33 to FA 2008 amends OTA83\S9(5)(a) so that a field that has become non-taxable by virtue of an election made under Schedule 20B remains a user field for the purposes of the tariff receipts allowance legislation.</p><sup>24</sup><p>As a result tariff receipts received from an elected non-taxable field under FA93\S185(IZA) will still be eligible for tariff receipts allowance</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\OT19250.xml</p><hr/><sup>0</sup><h3>Introduction</h3><sup>1</sup><p>FA 2008 introduced legislation that allowed participators in a PRT field to elect to make that field non-taxable.
