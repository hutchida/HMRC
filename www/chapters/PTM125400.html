So if a pension scheme holds 50% of company A which in turn owns 15% of a UK REIT then the pension schemes interest in the UK REIT will be 7.5%. The indirect holding in the UK REIT will therefore be less than 10%.</p><h3>Pension Schemes which are not occupational schemes</h3><p>A pension scheme which is not an occupational pension scheme may have holdings in a UK REIT through one or more arrangements for members that are not associated persons. In these circumstances the tests of whether 10% or more of the UK REIT is owned will apply separately for each arrangement. For the avoidance of doubt, where the same member has more than one arrangement, they must be considered jointly.</p><h3>Example</h3><p>A non-occupational pension scheme arrangement A owns 50% of a UK REIT and arrangement B owns 5% of the same UK REIT and the UK REIT owns a residential property. Arrangement A and arrangement B relate to members who are not the same person and are not connected with each other. Arrangement A will be treated as having an indirect holding in the residential property and as the limit is exceeded the appropriate tax charges will apply - see &#8216;Tax charges that apply&#8217; below. Arrangement B will not be treated as having an indirect holding in the property.</p><h3>Increases in holding by a pension scheme</h3><p>If the holding of a pension scheme increases without the pension scheme acquiring a further holding in the UK REIT this is not taken into account for the purposes of the 10% test unless it is part of a scheme or arrangement to enable a lower unauthorised payment to be charged. Therefore if a scheme owns 8% of a UK REIT and this is increased to 15% because others decrease their holdings this increase will not be taken into account unless it is done as a deliberate device to avoid the unauthorised payments charge.</p><h3>Apportioning value to a member</h3><p>The percentage by value represented by a member of a pension scheme is AM/AA x 100.</p><p>AM is an amount equal to the aggregate of the amount of the sums and the market value of the assets held for the purposes of an arrangement under the pension scheme relating to the member.</p><p>AA is an amount equal to the aggregate of the amount of the sums and the market value of the assets held for the purposes of the scheme.</p><h3>Meaning of &#8220;associated person&#8221;</h3><p>The term &#8220;associated person&#8221; in relation to a pension scheme means:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>any member of the pension scheme,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>any person connected with such a member,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>any arrangement (under that or another pension scheme) relating to a member of the pension scheme,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>any arrangement (under that or another pension scheme) relating to a person connected to such a member,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>any associated pension scheme.</p></li><p>A pension scheme is associated with another pension scheme if members representing at least 10% by value (see &#8216;Apportioning value to a member&#8217; above) of one pension scheme are members of the other pension scheme or connected with such members.</p><p>&#8220;Associated person&#8221; in relation to an arrangement means:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the member of the pension scheme to which that arrangement relates,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>any person connected with such a member,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>any arrangement (under that or another pension scheme) relating to a member of the pension scheme to which that arrangement relates,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>any arrangement (under that or another pension scheme) relating to a person connected to such a member.</p></li><p>Connected person means as defined in section 993 and 994 of Income Tax Act 2007 or section 1122 Corporation Tax Act 2010.

The pension scheme will be deemed to have made a capital gain.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM125400:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Amounts chargeable on gains: How gains are calculated</h3><p>If an asset is held indirectly by a pension scheme and a capital gain arises the cost of the asset for the purpose of calculating the capital gain is taken to be the total amount of unauthorised payments that have been charged on that scheme in relation to the asset. There is subtracted from this amount any part of the amount of unauthorised payments that were previously used in a part disposal of the asset.</p><p>The amount of the consideration for the chargeable gain differs depending on whether the asset is sold by the vehicle or whether the pension scheme&#8217;s interest in the vehicle is reduced.</p><p>If the vehicle disposes of the asset the consideration for that disposal is the amount the vehicle received for the asset. However if the asset was disposed of to a connected person or in a transaction that is not at arm&#8217;s length the consideration is the market value of the taxable asset.</p><p>If the pension scheme reduces its holding in the vehicle the amount of the consideration is taken to be the market value of the taxable asset.</p><p>In both circumstances the amount of the gain is determined by the holding the pension scheme has in the vehicle at that time.</p><p>If any tax is paid on the disposal by the vehicle that disposes of the asset this is allowed to be set off against any tax charged on the capital gain as a scheme sanction charge. The amount allowed to be set off is the proportion of the tax paid that relates to the pension schemes holding in the vehicle. Therefore if the pension scheme holds 50% of the vehicle 50% of the tax is allowed as a deduction.</p><p>The following examples demonstrate how this will work.</p><h3>Example 1</h3><p>The pension scheme holds 100% of a company which in turn holds a residential property. The unauthorised payments related to that taxable property were &#163;100,000. The vehicle disposes of the residential property to an unconnected person for &#163;200,000. For the purposes of the capital gain the cost of the asset is taken to be &#163;100,000 and the sale proceeds are taken to be &#163;200,000.</p><p>In this example if the company makes a part disposal of 50% of the asset then only 50% of the total unauthorised payments are allowed as the cost of the asset for calculating the capital gain.</p><h3>Example 2</h3><p>The pension scheme holds 100% of a company and the company owns a residential property. The unauthorised payments charged on the pension scheme in relation to the asset were &#163;100,000. The pension scheme disposes of 50% of its shares in the company when the market value of the asset is &#163;200,000.</p><p>The cost of the asset for the purposes of the capital gains computation is taken to be 50% of the unauthorised payments charged - i.e. &#163;50,000. The sale proceeds are deemed to be 50% of the market value of the property i.e. &#163;100,000.</p><h3>Example 3</h3><p>The company in example 2 subsequently disposes of its holding in the property for &#163;250,000. The amount of unauthorised payments charged in relation to the asset was &#163;100,000. However &#163;50,000 was used in the previous capital gain and therefore only &#163;50,000 is available to set against this gain.</p><p>When the company disposed of the property the pension scheme held 50% of that company. Therefore the consideration for the disposal is deemed to be 50% of the actual sale proceeds.</p><p>The capital gain is therefore based on a deemed sale proceeds of &#163;125,000 and costs of &#163;50,000.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM125300:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM125500:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><table colsep="0" frame="none" pgwide="1" rowsep="0"><tgroup cols="2" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><colspec colname="C1" colnum="1" colsep="0" colwidth="50%" rowsep="0" /><colspec colname="C2" colnum="2" colsep="0" colwidth="50%" rowsep="0" /><tbody><tr rowsep="0"><td align="left" valign="top">Glossary</td><td align="left" valign="top"><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM000001:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM000001</remotelink></td></tr><tr rowsep="0"><td align="left" valign="top">&#160;</td><td align="left" valign="top">&#160;</td></tr></tbody></tgroup></table><p>&#160;</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM125400:MANUAL-PARA_IDAVQZMD:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Indirect holding of taxable property</remotelink><nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM125400:MANUAL-PARA_IDA40ZMD:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Indirect holdings not subject to tax charges</remotelink><nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM125400:MANUAL-PARA_IDA01ZMD:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Indirect holdings not subject to tax charges: UK REITS</remotelink><nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM125400:MANUAL-PARA_IDANC0MD:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Indirect holdings not subject to tax charges: Other kinds of vehicle</remotelink><nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM125400:MANUAL-PARA_IDAEJ0MD:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Indirect holdings not subject to tax charges: Trading concerns</remotelink><nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM125400:MANUAL-PARA_IDARK0MD:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Indirect holdings of tangible moveable property that is not taxable property</remotelink><nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM125400:MANUAL-PARA_IDA1L0MD:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">What are the occasions of charge?</remotelink><nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM125400:MANUAL-PARA_IDATP0MD:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Tax charges that apply</remotelink><nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM125400:MANUAL-PARA_IDAMR0MD:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Amount and timing of charges on acquisition/improvement/conversion</remotelink><nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM125400:MANUAL-PARA_IDALM1MD:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Additional acquisition of interest in vehicle</remotelink><nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM125400:MANUAL-PARA_IDA2N1MD:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Additional property and any improvement/conversion/adaptation</remotelink><nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM125400:MANUAL-PARA_IDACQ1MD:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Amounts chargeable on income/deemed income</remotelink><nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM125400:MANUAL-PARA_IDA0T1MD:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Amounts chargeable on gains</remotelink><nl /><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM125400:MANUAL-PARA_IDACV1MD:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Amounts chargeable on gains: How gains are calculated</remotelink></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><h3>Indirect holding of taxable property</h3><p>Section 174A and Paragraphs 16 to 19 Schedule 29A Finance Act 2004</p><p>The taxable property provisions apply where an investment-regulated pension scheme holds either a direct or indirect interest in taxable property. <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM121000:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM121000</remotelink> explains the position for direct interests and the following paragraphs explain the position for indirect interests.</p><p>An indirect interest in taxable property will be held through a &#8220;vehicle&#8221;, i.e., a person or entity through whom the pension scheme holds the property.

So if a pension scheme holds 50% of company A which in turn owns 15% of a UK REIT then the pension schemes interest in the UK REIT will be 7.5%. The indirect holding in the UK REIT will therefore be less than 10%.</p><h3>Pension Schemes which are not occupational schemes</h3><p>A pension scheme which is not an occupational pension scheme may have holdings in a UK REIT through one or more arrangements for members that are not associated persons. In these circumstances the tests of whether 10% or more of the UK REIT is owned will apply separately for each arrangement. For the avoidance of doubt, where the same member has more than one arrangement, they must be considered jointly.</p><h3>Example</h3><p>A non-occupational pension scheme arrangement A owns 50% of a UK REIT and arrangement B owns 5% of the same UK REIT and the UK REIT owns a residential property. Arrangement A and arrangement B relate to members who are not the same person and are not connected with each other. Arrangement A will be treated as having an indirect holding in the residential property and as the limit is exceeded the appropriate tax charges will apply - see &#8216;Tax charges that apply&#8217; below. Arrangement B will not be treated as having an indirect holding in the property.</p><h3>Increases in holding by a pension scheme</h3><p>If the holding of a pension scheme increases without the pension scheme acquiring a further holding in the UK REIT this is not taken into account for the purposes of the 10% test unless it is part of a scheme or arrangement to enable a lower unauthorised payment to be charged. Therefore if a scheme owns 8% of a UK REIT and this is increased to 15% because others decrease their holdings this increase will not be taken into account unless it is done as a deliberate device to avoid the unauthorised payments charge.</p><h3>Apportioning value to a member</h3><p>The percentage by value represented by a member of a pension scheme is AM/AA x 100.</p><p>AM is an amount equal to the aggregate of the amount of the sums and the market value of the assets held for the purposes of an arrangement under the pension scheme relating to the member.</p><p>AA is an amount equal to the aggregate of the amount of the sums and the market value of the assets held for the purposes of the scheme.</p><h3>Meaning of &#8220;associated person&#8221;</h3><p>The term &#8220;associated person&#8221; in relation to a pension scheme means:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>any member of the pension scheme,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>any person connected with such a member,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>any arrangement (under that or another pension scheme) relating to a member of the pension scheme,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>any arrangement (under that or another pension scheme) relating to a person connected to such a member,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>any associated pension scheme.</p></li><p>A pension scheme is associated with another pension scheme if members representing at least 10% by value (see &#8216;Apportioning value to a member&#8217; above) of one pension scheme are members of the other pension scheme or connected with such members.</p><p>&#8220;Associated person&#8221; in relation to an arrangement means:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the member of the pension scheme to which that arrangement relates,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>any person connected with such a member,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>any arrangement (under that or another pension scheme) relating to a member of the pension scheme to which that arrangement relates,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>any arrangement (under that or another pension scheme) relating to a person connected to such a member.</p></li><p>Connected person means as defined in section 993 and 994 of Income Tax Act 2007 or section 1122 Corporation Tax Act 2010.

Arrangement A will be treated as having an indirect holding in the residential property and as the limit is exceeded the appropriate tax charges will apply, see &#8216;Tax charges&#160;that apply&#8217; below. Arrangement B will not be treated as having an indirect holding in the property.</p><h3>Increases in holding by a pension scheme</h3><p>If the holding of a pension scheme increases without the pension scheme acquiring a further holding in the vehicle this is not taken into account for the purposes of the 10% test unless it is part of a scheme or arrangement to enable a lower unauthorised payment to be charged. Therefore if a scheme owns 8% of an open ended vehicle and this is increased to 15% because others decrease their holdings this increase will not be taken into account unless it is done as a deliberate device to avoid the unauthorised payments charge.</p><h3>Apportioning value to a member</h3><p>The percentage by value represented by a member of a pension scheme is AM/AA x 100.</p><p>AM is an amount equal to the aggregate of the amount of the sums and the market value of the assets held for the purposes of an arrangement under the pension scheme relating to the member</p><p>AA is an amount equal to the aggregate of the amount of the sums and the market value of the assets held for the purposes of the scheme.</p><h3>Meaning of &#8220;associated person&#8221;</h3><p>See above for UK REITS.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM125400:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Indirect holdings not subject to tax charges: Trading concerns</h3><p>These are vehicles that are arm&#8217;s length trading vehicles.

There is subtracted from this amount any part of the amount of unauthorised payments that were previously used in a part disposal of the asset.</p><p>The amount of the consideration for the chargeable gain differs depending on whether the asset is sold by the vehicle or whether the pension scheme&#8217;s interest in the vehicle is reduced.</p><p>If the vehicle disposes of the asset the consideration for that disposal is the amount the vehicle received for the asset. However if the asset was disposed of to a connected person or in a transaction that is not at arm&#8217;s length the consideration is the market value of the taxable asset.</p><p>If the pension scheme reduces its holding in the vehicle the amount of the consideration is taken to be the market value of the taxable asset.</p><p>In both circumstances the amount of the gain is determined by the holding the pension scheme has in the vehicle at that time.</p><p>If any tax is paid on the disposal by the vehicle that disposes of the asset this is allowed to be set off against any tax charged on the capital gain as a scheme sanction charge. The amount allowed to be set off is the proportion of the tax paid that relates to the pension schemes holding in the vehicle. Therefore if the pension scheme holds 50% of the vehicle 50% of the tax is allowed as a deduction.</p><p>The following examples demonstrate how this will work.</p><h3>Example 1</h3><p>The pension scheme holds 100% of a company which in turn holds a residential property. The unauthorised payments related to that taxable property were &#163;100,000. The vehicle disposes of the residential property to an unconnected person for &#163;200,000. For the purposes of the capital gain the cost of the asset is taken to be &#163;100,000 and the sale proceeds are taken to be &#163;200,000.</p><p>In this example if the company makes a part disposal of 50% of the asset then only 50% of the total unauthorised payments are allowed as the cost of the asset for calculating the capital gain.</p><h3>Example 2</h3><p>The pension scheme holds 100% of a company and the company owns a residential property. The unauthorised payments charged on the pension scheme in relation to the asset were &#163;100,000. The pension scheme disposes of 50% of its shares in the company when the market value of the asset is &#163;200,000.</p><p>The cost of the asset for the purposes of the capital gains computation is taken to be 50% of the unauthorised payments charged - i.e. &#163;50,000. The sale proceeds are deemed to be 50% of the market value of the property i.e. &#163;100,000.</p><h3>Example 3</h3><p>The company in example 2 subsequently disposes of its holding in the property for &#163;250,000. The amount of unauthorised payments charged in relation to the asset was &#163;100,000. However &#163;50,000 was used in the previous capital gain and therefore only &#163;50,000 is available to set against this gain.</p><p>When the company disposed of the property the pension scheme held 50% of that company. Therefore the consideration for the disposal is deemed to be 50% of the actual sale proceeds.</p><p>The capital gain is therefore based on a deemed sale proceeds of &#163;125,000 and costs of &#163;50,000.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM125300:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM125500:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div></div></body></html>
