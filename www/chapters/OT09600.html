It then leases back the asset, securing relief on its lease payments in respect of the continuing use of the asset. The company thus obtains double relief for the same asset: once for the expenditure incurred when the asset was originally acquired, and once again for the finance lease payments.

This is done by placing a ‘cap’ on the total amount of PRT relief allowable on expenditure related to the asset. Where the PRT liability for the disposal period has been reduced by safeguard relief, the cap is equal to the lower of</p><sup>7</sup><p>the marginal amount of PRT payable on the disposal proceeds divided by the PRT rate for that period</p><sup>8</sup><p>and the disposal proceeds.</p><sup>9</sup><p>Thus, if no PRT is paid on the disposal proceeds, because of the operation of safeguard, then none of the lease payments will be allowable. If PRT is paid on only a proportion of the disposal proceeds because of the operation of safeguard, relief will be given on a proportion on the lease payments.</p><sup>10</sup><p>The cap operates on an aggregate basis, so the rentals are only restricted once the cap is reached.

Interest payments are not an allowable expense for PRT purposes but prior to FA99 companies were able to use sale and leaseback deals to raise finance and effectively obtain relief on the interest element of lease payments, subject to OTA75\S3 and OTA75\S4, and OTA83\S3 being satisfied. Companies are now denied relief for lease payments that exceed the sale proceeds. Even where disposal proceeds are not sheltered by safeguard, no relief will be given for lease payments in excess of the disposal receipts (the ‘cap’).</p><sup>14</sup><h3>Miscellaneous points</h3><sup>15</sup><p>The legislation applies equally to both sale and leasebacks involving third parties and to those involving connected persons, e.g. where the asset is leased back by a person connected (under ICTA88\S839) with the seller.</p><sup>16</sup><p>There are provisions for apportioning the cap where the asset is used in connection with more than one field.</p><sup>17</sup><p>The legislation continues to apply if the sale and leaseback is followed by a transfer of the field interest. The company that has newly acquired the field interest is treated as if it were the company that originally sold and leased back the asset, and as if the new lease for the use of the asset were the original lease. The new lessee steps into the shoes of the previous lessee and inherits his cap on lease payments and his history of lease payments already allowed. This applies to any subsequent transfers of the field interest. If there is a partial transfer of the interest, the transferee inherits the appropriate proportion of the transferor’s cap and lease payments.</p><sup>18</sup><p>The cap does not apply to ‘operating expenditure’ (as defined in FA99\S97) e.g. where a platform is leased back fully crewed, and the lease rentals reflect the provision of the crew. The element of the lease rentals relating to such expenditure is that which is judged just and reasonable and which the lessee or his successor would (or might have) incurred had there been no finance leasing arrangement, and it had been the owner of the asset.</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\OT09600.xml</p><hr/><sup>0</sup><h3>FA99\S95 and S97</h3><sup>1</sup><p>A company with an interest in the North Sea may raise finance by selling an asset (or an interest in one) and then leasing it back.
