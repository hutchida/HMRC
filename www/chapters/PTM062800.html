(Only scheme pensions are covered by this provision since other kinds of pension provision do not present the same difficulty).</p></li><li><lilabel>2</lilabel><p>If a member dies during a delay in providing their pension, then two further possibilities can arise. The first of these can be illustrated with the following example: suppose such a member became actually entitled (according to the tax rules) to the payment of pension during their lifetime. And suppose they also became entitled to an arrear payment under SI 2006/614. In such an example, a back-payment of pension from the date of entitlement up to the time of their death is definitely due. Likewise, any arrear due under SI 2006/614 still has to be paid.</p></li><p>The first hurdle to authorising such a payment would seem to arise with pension rule 2 in section 165 Finance Act 2004: taken literally, this would appear to prevent any payment (other than certain guarantees <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM062400:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM062400</remotelink>), being made after death. However HMRC interprets pension rule 2 in section 165 Finance Act 2004 to be referring to payment in the context of accrual of pension after death. According to this interpretation, the rule does not prevent payment of amounts already accrued during the member&#8217;s lifetime. And indeed, the tax rules allow any assessment to income tax, to look back to the years in which the pension actually accrued rather than the date it was paid. In practice most recipients are happy to not re-open earlier years and simply accept PAYE taxation at the time of payment.</p><p>Typically, the payment would be made to the estate of the deceased (i.e. to their legal personal representative) as an authorised member payment using the P45 procedure - effectively taxing the pension arrear as the member&#8217;s own income.</p><li><lilabel>1</lilabel><p>The other possibility where a member dies during a delay in providing pension is that they die before fulfilling the formalities that are required to become entitled to the payment of that pension according to the tax rules. This does not mean that the scheme does not have some obligation to make some back-payments. However the tax rules put up the following hurdles to making the payment:</p></li><p>* no entitlement to pension will have accrued under the tax rules before death * further accrual is not possible after death, since there is no authorised pre-death pension that could continue under a guarantee * no fresh entitlement to pension can arise for the member once they have died, and * the &#8216;Arrears of Pension&#8217; Regulations (which hinge upon actual entitlement arising during the member&#8217;s lifetime), will not apply. </p><p>All of which mean that the payment looks set to be unauthorised.

This does not mean that the scheme does not have some obligation to make some back-payments. However the tax rules put up the following hurdles to making the payment:</p></li><p>* no entitlement to pension will have accrued under the tax rules before death * further accrual is not possible after death, since there is no authorised pre-death pension that could continue under a guarantee * no fresh entitlement to pension can arise for the member once they have died, and * the &#8216;Arrears of Pension&#8217; Regulations (which hinge upon actual entitlement arising during the member&#8217;s lifetime), will not apply. </p><p>All of which mean that the payment looks set to be unauthorised. This is where regulation 16 of the &#8216;Authorised Payment&#8217; Regulations SI 2009/1171 may help.</p><h3>Regulation 16</h3><p>This provides that an arrear of scheme pension paid to or in respect of the member, will be an authorised member payment so long as the following conditions are met:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the payment arises from a defined benefits arrangement</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the member had died either after 5 April 2011 or both before 6 April 2011 and&#160;reaching age 75</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><nl />the member was at &#8216;arm&#8217;s length&#8217; from any sponsoring employer of:<li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the scheme paying the arrear, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>any other scheme that is both an occupational pension scheme and a registered pension scheme, which relates to the same employment as the paying scheme relates to (any &#8216;related scheme&#8217;), and</p></li></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the payment represents accrued arrears of pension, and the scheme administrator had not established the member&#8217;s entitlement to the pension (arrear) until after the member&#8217;s death</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the payment, had it been made immediately before the member&#8217;s death and had the member been entitled to it, would not have been an unauthorised payment, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the scheme administrator could not reasonably have been expected to make the payment before the member&#8217;s death.</p></li><p>A member is said to be at &#8216;arm&#8217;s length&#8217; from a sponsoring employer if that individual is as described at <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM063260:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM063260</remotelink>.</p><p>How a person is &#8216;connected&#8217; with another person is set out in section 993 of the Income Tax Act 2007.
