This is not affected by a later carry-back of a trade loss.</p><p>Example 2 (CTM92252)</p><p>CT paid for an earlier accounting period is repaid, because of a loss carry-back claim, before the due date for the later accounting period.</p><p>If the loss carry-back claim were treated as not made (TMA70/S87A (6)) there would have been no repayment and no CT that would carry interest. Thus Section 87A (6) does not create an interest charge.</p><p>Example 3 (CTM92253)</p><p>When you give effect to a loss carry-back there is a wide range of reliefs that could be due instead if the loss carry-back claim is treated as not made under Section 87A (6).</p><p>You may need to take account of not only IT and CIS25/SC60 tax but also ACT, marginal small companies relief and double taxation relief.</p><p>Note: COTAX will not calculate late payment interest correctly in cases in which a carry-back displaces some other relief, see (b) of CTM92420.</p><p>Example 4 (CTM92254)</p><p>Another example of displacement. The company both carries on a trade and incurs non-trade charges on charitable donations. The non-trade charges are allowable under CTA2010/S189.&#160;The non-trade charges are later displaced by a trade loss carry-back, and those non- trade charges are surrendered as group relief.</p><p>Note: Trade charges would not be disturbed by a loss relief carry-back because of ICTA88/S393A (8) (CTM09100). Trade charges are not relevant to payments made on or after 16 March 2005.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM92240:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM92251:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>Examples illustrating points in <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_CTM92240:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CTM92240</remotelink> are as below.</p><p>Example 1 (<remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_CTM92251:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CTM92251</remotelink>)</p><p>A company pays tax late and sustains an interest charge.
