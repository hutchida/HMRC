The form of this modified approach was the product of a constructive discussion with the Industry Representative Bodies following which LB Oil &amp; Gas has accepted that, where the modified approach applies, the expenditure allocable to the tax-exempt tariffing use will be the amount equivalent to 50% of the gross tariff from the user field, subject to the limitation that the expenditure allocated cannot exceed average cost or be less than the incremental cost (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT15940:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT15940</remotelink>). </p><p>The modified approach has been broadly endorsed by the Industry Representative Bodies. While the endorsements do not bind their members there is an expectation that the modified approach will be followed in the majority of tax-exempt tariffing situations.

If, exceptionally, the responsible person for the host field or the substitute operator consider that an alternative approach is required to achieve a just and reasonable apportionment LB Oil &amp; Gas will need to be satisfied that this is the case.
