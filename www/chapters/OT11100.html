On this basis, a multi-support vessel used say 80% of the time on one field and the remaining 20% of the time on six other fields would be regarded as being predominately used on the 80% field and therefore dedicated to it.

Note that for the purpose of the apportionment the length of time the asset has been used in connection with the field will include all earlier periods. Expenditure previously allowed is to be taken into account adjusting for any additional or excess relief together with any relevant supplement.</p><sup>14</sup><h4>(3) Part Field Use, OTA75\S4(11)</h4><sup>15</sup><p>If the asset is simultaneously used partly in connection with the field and partly otherwise during the claim period, the allowable expenditure is apportioned according to how it has been used.</p><sup>16</sup><h4>Disposals, OTA83\S1(4)</h4><sup>17</sup><p>If a non-dedicated mobile asset is disposed of after 30 June 1982, the disposal receipt provisions of OTA83\S7 (see OT15060) do not apply. Instead, the treatment applicable to disposals of long-term assets prior to 1 July 1982 (OTA75\Sch4\Para4 in relation to disposals and OTA75\Sch4\Para7 in relation to insurance and compensation) continues to apply.
