Where the facts indicate that a capital contribution or undrawn profits is not a loan/advance or debt, then neither Section 455 nor Section 459 can apply where the individual partners who are also company participators draw on those funds in the partnership, for example by overdrawing their capital or current accounts with the partnership.</p><p>A typical structure/scenario would involve, for example:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>a company, C, with a sole participator, M</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>M and C are also the sole members of an LLP, S </p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>C, the company member, gets 99% of the profits of S</p></li><p>M receives a 1% profit share and has &#163;5000 accumulated profits at his disposal in his capital/current account.</p><p>The profits allocated to C are taxed at the corporation tax rates which are substantially lower than the higher income tax rates/NIC which might otherwise have been applied to those profits.
