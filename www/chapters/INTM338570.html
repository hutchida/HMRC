The list should show the members separately in country by country “blocks”. This allows us to be certain that proper amounts of treaty relief are being allowed.</p><sup>2</sup><p>Where the Syndicate Manager provides a full country by country breakdown of the syndicate members, if a lending member of a syndicate is resident in a country with which we do not have a double taxation convention we can check that UK tax is deducted from the interest payments.</p><sup>3</sup><p>It is also possible that a syndicate member might be a UK bank. In which case no tax is deductible because of the provisions of ICTA88/S840A. Or the lender may be entitled to gross payment of interest because of ICTA88/S349A.</p><sup>4</sup><p>A recommended format for listing the separate members of each Syndicate is given with each of the forms.</p><sup>5</sup><p>Example</p><sup>6</sup><p>FORMAT FOR LISTING BY “BLOCKS” THE LENDING MEMBERS OF A SYNDICATE</p><sup>7</sup><p>Each list or Block should be preceded by the name of the syndicate and a statement to the effect that</p><sup>8</sup><p>“The following are lending members of the syndicate who have been represented to the Syndicate Manager as being</p><sup>9</sup><p>resident in ………………………………………………………………………….(name of country), OR</p><sup>10</sup><p>resident in the UK but being banks within the meaning of Section 840A ICTA 1988, OR</p><sup>11</sup><p>resident in the UK (other than S840A banks).”</p><sup>12</sup><p>This should be followed by a list of the appropriate lending members, detailing their complete names and addresses (together with full details of any relevant facility office, if different).</p><sup>13</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>14</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
