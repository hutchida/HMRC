The ECJ held that there was a “single complex supply of services in which the parking element is predominant”.</p><sup>1</sup><p>The ECJ made a significant point at para 31 of the judgment where the court states: “the fact that, in other circumstances, the elements in issue can be or are supplied separately is of no importance, given that possibility is inherent in the concept of a single composite transaction”. This reinforces the principle of looking at the economic reality of the situation rather than artificially separating out elements of a single supply.</p><sup>2</sup><p>The ECJ also considered the application of the principle of fiscal neutrality is not a primary issue when considering the supply position because ‘a complex supply of services consisting of separate elements is not automatically similar to the supply of those elements separately’ leading to a ‘necessarily’ different tax treatment (paras 38 and 39 refer). Fiscal neutrality is only a relevant consideration when two supplies are in competition with each other.</p><sup>3</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>4</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
