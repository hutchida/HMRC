There was no expectation, therefore, either in 1984 or at any later date, that quota had a finite life of less than 50 years.</p><h3>Partnerships</h3><p>Milk quota allocated to a holding farmed in partnership is regarded as a partnership asset. Any consideration received on a disposal of quota will, therefore, be allocated among the partners in accordance with the normal rules for partnership assets, see CG27350.</p><h3>Tenant Farmers: Termination of tenancy</h3><p>If a tenancy is terminated then the milk quota reverts to the landlord. In these circumstances, the outgoing tenant may seek the landlord&#8217;s permission to dispose of the quota. If that happens, the landlord may receive a payment from the tenant.</p><p>Where agreement to sell is not sought, then the tenant and landlord may agree an amount of compensation payable to the tenant for the loss of the quota. If no agreement is reached, then the tenant is entitled to statutory compensation, Section 13 Agriculture Act 1986.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CG77940:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Agreed compensation</h3><p>If the compensation is paid under a contractual agreement which provided for the reversion of the quota, then the normal rules in TCGA92/S28 apply.
