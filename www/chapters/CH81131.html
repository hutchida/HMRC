It relies on several agents to sell the insurance policies and to collect the premiums due. The agents are required to send XYZ a periodic report showing details of the policies sold, the amounts of premium, the commission due to the agents and Insurance Premium Tax (IPT). XYZ uses this information to compile its IPT return. Despite having extensive systems in place to capture and process the information, the agents are occasionally late in sending their reports to XYZ. As a consequence, XYZ does not always have all the information it requires in time to compile its IPT returns. So XYZ follows the guidance in the IPT Public Notice and estimates the gross premium. Estimation should be based on a representative sample of the final selling price charged by XYZ’s intermediaries. XYZ should agree any estimation with HMRC.</p><sup>7</sup><h4>Example 4</h4><sup>8</sup><p>KBY Oil Ltd makes its return based on figures obtained from meter readings.
