In this context profits do not include distributions received from a company resident in the UK. The provisions for the payment of ACT and for the deduction and accounting for IT do not apply to a non-resident company although the provisions of ITA07/Part15/Chapter 15 (formerly ICTA88/SCH16) will apply if the company is a deposit taker.</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\CTM01105.xml</p><hr/><sup>0</sup><p>A company (see</p><sup>1</sup><p>The charge to CT is made on the profits arising in a company’s accounting period (</p><sup>2</sup><p>So the CT computation for any company for an accounting period includes:</p><sup>3</sup><p>any income of the company arising in that accounting period which is within the charge to CT, subject to any specific modifications provided by the Taxes Acts, and</p><sup>4</sup><p>any chargeable gains arising in that accounting period.</p><sup>5</sup><p>Income and chargeable gains are aggregated to arrive at the total profits of the accounting period.</p><sup>6</sup><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">CT is normally due and payable nine months and one day from the end of that accounting period (</p><sup>7</sup><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Before 6 April 1999 where a company paid a dividend or other qualifying distribution (</p><sup>8</sup><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Members of groups of companies resident in the UK are assessable separately to CT, but are subject to a number of special provisions.
