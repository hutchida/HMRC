The payer can therefore act on the basis of assurances given by the recipient or by an intermediary if it considers these assurances to be sufficient grounds for reasonable belief. For example, where a shareholder or intermediary completes a declaration that they are either the beneficial owner of a shareholding or that they are holding the shareholding on behalf of the beneficial owner in a Property AIF and they confirm that they (or the beneficial owner) are eligible for gross payments under regulation 69Z4 SI 2006/964, HMRC would consider that to be evidence of ‘reasonable belief’.</p><sup>1</sup><p>HMRC staff have a duty of confidentiality to taxpayers and is unlikely to be able to respond to requests for confirmation that the recipient is eligible for gross payments.

As soon as the mistake is discovered, the Property AIF should send in an amended return, and pay over the additional tax due (regulation 69Z35 SI 2006/964).
