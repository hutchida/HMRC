This is because the benefits the individual has protected under primary protection should include the value of the pension rights from the pension credit, so the primary protection factor the individual has received will incorporate the pre-commencement pension credit element.</p><sup>22</sup><p>Top of page</p><sup>23</sup><h4>Notification procedure for the pre-commencement pension credit factor</h4><sup>24</sup><p>Regulations 5 and 12 The Registered Pension Schemes (Enhanced Lifetime Allowance) Regulations 2006 SI 2006/131</p><sup>25</sup><p>An individual normally had to notify HMRC of their entitlement to a pre-commencement pension credit factor using form APSS 201 in the period 6 April 2006 to 5 April 2009. HMRC may accept a late notification in limited circumstances. See PTM098000 for guidance on late notification.</p><sup>26</sup><p>HMRC will issue a certificate confirming the pre-commencement pension credit factor the individual is entitled to. The certificate is valid until such time as the certificate (or any amended certificate) is revoked or amended by HMRC.</p><sup>27</sup><p>If after the claim has been made the individual learns that the information provided was incorrect, they must inform HMRC as soon as possible.
