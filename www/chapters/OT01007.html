A Notice of Proposed Determination is sent to all licensees involved. Recipients have 60 days in which to make any objections in writing and objecting parties can make representations in more detail, before a final determination is issued. The final decision on the determination rests with the Secretary of State.

If it could be demonstrated by the current licensees that PRT would prevent a previously undeveloped area from going ahead on economic grounds, then DECC would under certain circumstances redetermine the field. The undeveloped area would then become a new non-taxable field with the original taxable field being diminished in size accordingly. Such a change requires the approval of both Treasury and DECC ministers.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT01001:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT01009:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>DECC is responsible for determining field boundaries.
