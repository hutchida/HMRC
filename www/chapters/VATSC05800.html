It is important to remember though that services are only within the scope of VAT when there is consideration for them, whether monetary or non-monetary. There are exceptions to this rule and these are referred to below.</p><sup>4</sup><h4>VAT Act 1994, Schedule 4 paragraph 1(1) and paragraph 5(4)</h4><sup>5</sup><p>In addition, because goods are involved in them, the VAT Act identifies particular transactions as supplies of services in order not to confuse them with supplies of goods. These supplies are:</p><sup>6</sup><p>lease/ hire of goods</p><sup>7</sup><p>transfer/ sale of an undivided share of title in goods</p><sup>8</sup><p>the temporary application of business assets for non-business use, whether or not for a consideration.</p><sup>9</sup><p>It is important to distinguish these supplies from supplies of goods because there are different tax point - see VATTOS - and other provisions applying to goods and services.</p><sup>10</sup><h4>VAT (Supply of Services) Order 1993 (SI 1993/1507)</h4><sup>11</sup><p>This Order also makes a supply of services of the application of services to private or other non-business use, whether or not for a consideration.</p><sup>12</sup><p>For more on this see V1-13 Input Tax.</p><sup>13</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>14</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
