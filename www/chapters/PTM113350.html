In 2014-15 Ivan is a currently-relieved member of this scheme with a pension input amount of &#163;65,000 under the scheme. Ivan&#8217;s pension input amount is adjusted by the appropriate fraction to &#163;60,000. The annual allowance that year is &#163;40,000.</p><p>In the previous three tax years Ivan&#8217;s pension input amounts were:</p><p>2013-14 - &#163;45,000 - to the XYZ Overseas Pension Scheme</p><p>2012-13 - &#163;30,000 - to the XYZ Overseas Pension Scheme</p><p>2011-12 - &#163;25,000 - to the A N Other Overseas Employer Pension Scheme</p><p>For 2013-14 Ivan qualified for UK tax relief in respect of his pension savings and his pension input amount for that year after application of the appropriate fraction was &#163;42,000. The annual allowance for 2013-14 was &#163;50,000 so Ivan has &#163;8,000 unused annual allowance to carry forward.</p><p>In 2012-13 Ivan did not qualify for any UK tax relief, so the annual allowance rules did not apply to his pension savings. Because of this there is no adjustment by the appropriate fraction to Ivan&#8217;s pension input amount of &#163;30,000 for that year. The annual allowance for 2012-13 was &#163;50,000 so Ivan has &#163;20,000 unused annual allowance to carry forward.</p><p>In 2011-12 Ivan did not qualify for any UK tax relief in respect of his pension savings. Also as Ivan&#8217;s pension savings were made under a different pension scheme they are outside the reach of paragraph 9A Schedule 34 Finance Act 2004 and so there can be no carry forward of any unused annual allowance.</p><p>In summary, Ivan has unused annual allowance to carry forward as follows:</p><p>2013-14 - &#163;8,000</p><p>2012-13 - &#163;20,000</p><p>2011-12 - nil</p><p>This means Ivan has a total of &#163;28,000 unused annual allowance to carry forward.</p><p>Together with the &#163;40,000 annual allowance for the tax year, Ivan can have pension input amounts of &#163;68,000 in 2014-15 without the annual allowance charge being due.</p><p>Ivan&#8217;s total pension input amount for the 2014-15 tax year is &#163;60,000, which is &#163;8,000 less than his available annual allowance. Ivan does not have to pay the annual allowance charge.</p><p>Ivan has used up the annual allowance for the current tax year (&#163;40,000 for 2014-15). He has also used up the &#163;20,000 unused annual allowance from 2012-13. Ivan still has &#163;8,000 unused annual allowance from 2013-14 to carry forward to the next tax year. Note: there is a strict order of the use of unused annual allowance (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM055000:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM055000</remotelink>).</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM113350:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Currently-relieved member was not a member of the currently-relieved non-UK pension scheme for any of the previous three tax years?</h3><p>A currently-relieved member of a currently-relieved non-UK pension scheme who was not a member of the scheme in any of the last three tax years might still be able to carry forward any unused annual allowance. It would be possible only if, during one or more of those years, the individual was a member of a registered pension scheme or a member of another overseas pension scheme in respect of which the individual got UK tax relief for the year concerned and the individual has unused annual allowance to carry forward.
