However, for the tax year in question, the appropriate fraction does not apply to calculation of the pension input amount.</p><sup>9</sup><p>The member may not be able to carry forward unused annual allowance from one or more of the previous three tax years if the individual was not a member of the current currently-relieved non-UK pension scheme during any part of that earlier tax year, for example because the individual was in a different pension scheme of the current employer or was in a pension scheme of another employer.</p><sup>10</sup><p>If the individual was in a different pension scheme in an earlier tax year it might still be possible to carry forward but only if that other pension scheme was either a registered pension scheme or was, itself, a currently-relieved non-UK pension scheme because the individual got UK tax relief for the year concerned in respect of that scheme.</p><sup>11</sup><h3>Example</h3><sup>12</sup><p>The XYZ Overseas Pension Scheme is a currently-relieved non-UK pension scheme. In 2014-15 Ivan is a currently-relieved member of this scheme with a pension input amount of £65,000 under the scheme. Ivan’s pension input amount is adjusted by the appropriate fraction to £60,000. The annual allowance that year is £40,000.</p><sup>13</sup><p>In the previous three tax years Ivan’s pension input amounts were:</p><sup>14</sup><p>2013-14 - £45,000 - to the XYZ Overseas Pension Scheme</p><sup>15</sup><p>2012-13 - £30,000 - to the XYZ Overseas Pension Scheme</p><sup>16</sup><p>2011-12 - £25,000 - to the A N Other Overseas Employer Pension Scheme</p><sup>17</sup><p>For 2013-14 Ivan qualified for UK tax relief in respect of his pension savings and his pension input amount for that year after application of the appropriate fraction was £42,000.

Because of this there is no adjustment by the appropriate fraction to Ivan’s pension input amount of £30,000 for that year. The annual allowance for 2012-13 was £50,000 so Ivan has £20,000 unused annual allowance to carry forward.</p><sup>19</sup><p>In 2011-12 Ivan did not qualify for any UK tax relief in respect of his pension savings. Also as Ivan’s pension savings were made under a different pension scheme they are outside the reach of paragraph 9A Schedule 34 Finance Act 2004 and so there can be no carry forward of any unused annual allowance.</p><sup>20</sup><p>In summary, Ivan has unused annual allowance to carry forward as follows:</p><sup>21</sup><p>2013-14 - £8,000</p><sup>22</sup><p>2012-13 - £20,000</p><sup>23</sup><p>2011-12 - nil</p><sup>24</sup><p>This means Ivan has a total of £28,000 unused annual allowance to carry forward.</p><sup>25</sup><p>Together with the £40,000 annual allowance for the tax year, Ivan can have pension input amounts of £68,000 in 2014-15 without the annual allowance charge being due.</p><sup>26</sup><p>Ivan’s total pension input amount for the 2014-15 tax year is £60,000, which is £8,000 less than his available annual allowance.

He has also used up the £20,000 unused annual allowance from 2012-13. Ivan still has £8,000 unused annual allowance from 2013-14 to carry forward to the next tax year.

It would be possible only if, during one or more of those years, the individual was a member of a registered pension scheme or a member of another overseas pension scheme in respect of which the individual got UK tax relief for the year concerned and the individual has unused annual allowance to carry forward.
