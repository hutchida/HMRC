So the tax year in which the pension commencement lump sum is paid may be different from the tax year in which it crystallises.

In June 2008 she receives a pension commencement lump sum of £300,000 and a scheme pension with a crystallised value of £1.2 million.</p><sup>9</sup><p>The maximum amount for a pension commencement lump sum in these circumstances if Fiona did not have protection would be £375,000. The £300,000 lump sum is not reportable as it is not more than the standard permitted maximum for a pension commencement lump sum.</p><sup>10</sup><p>In March 2013 Fiona is paid a £200,000 pension commencement lump sum. On 5 May 2013 she crystallises £800,000 as a lifetime annuity. This lump sum is reportable in the 2012-13 Event Report as a reportable event 8 because:</p><sup>11</sup><p>the lump sum was paid in 2012-13 (although the BCE for lump sum occurs on 5 May 2013 - in 2013-14), and</p><sup>12</sup><p>the £200,000 lump sum is more than the permitted maximum for a non-protected pension commencement lump sum (which would be £0).

The £1.5 million Fiona crystallised in 2008-09 used up 100 per cent of the standard lifetime allowance. This means that both BCE 6 for the pension commencement lump sum and the BCE 4 for the lifetime annuity are more than the standard lifetime allowance.
