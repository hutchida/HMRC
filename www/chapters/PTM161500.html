The pension commencement lump sum crystallises (the member becomes entitled to it) immediately before the connected pension. So the tax year in which the pension commencement lump sum is paid may be different from the tax year in which it crystallises. Where this happens, the test for whether or not the lump sum is reportable is made using the standard lifetime allowance for the tax year in which the pension commencement lump sum is paid.</p><h3>Example</h3><p>Fiona has enhanced protection and a protected lump sum of 20 per cent. In June 2008 she receives a pension commencement lump sum of &#163;300,000 and a scheme pension with a crystallised value of &#163;1.2 million.</p><p>The maximum amount for a pension commencement lump sum in these circumstances if Fiona did not have protection would be &#163;375,000. The &#163;300,000 lump sum is not reportable as it is not more than the standard permitted maximum for a pension commencement lump sum.</p><p>In March 2013 Fiona is paid a &#163;200,000 pension commencement lump sum. On 5 May 2013 she crystallises &#163;800,000 as a lifetime annuity. This lump sum is reportable in the 2012-13 Event Report as a reportable event 8 because:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the lump sum was paid in 2012-13 (although the BCE for lump sum occurs on 5 May 2013 - in 2013-14), and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the &#163;200,000 lump sum is more than the permitted maximum for a non-protected pension commencement lump sum (which would be &#163;0). This lump sum is only an authorised payment because Fiona has enhanced protection with protection of lump sum rights of more than &#163;375,000.</p></li><p>The &#163;200,000 pension commencement lump sum and &#163;800,000 lifetime annuity both crystallise in 2013-14 when the standard lifetime allowance is &#163;1.5 million. The &#163;1.5 million Fiona crystallised in 2008-09 used up 100 per cent of the standard lifetime allowance. This means that both BCE 6 for the pension commencement lump sum and the BCE 4 for the lifetime annuity are more than the standard lifetime allowance. These must be reported on the Event Report for 2013-14 as a reportable event 6.</p><p>The information to be provided on the Event Report for reportable event 8 is:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the name of the member</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>their National Insurance number (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM161200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM161200</remotelink> if the scheme administrator doesn&#8217;t have this)</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the amount of the payment</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the date of payment, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the reference number of the protection certificate issued by HMRC.</p></li><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM161500:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Reportable event 8A: Stand-alone lump sums</h3><p>Event number 8A relates to the payment of stand-alone lump sums.
