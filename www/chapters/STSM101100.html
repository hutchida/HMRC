It treats units which are issued as consideration by a PFPV as not being ‘stock’ for the purposes of stamp duty. In addition, a transfer of ‘units’ in a PFPV is not regarded as ‘chargeable securities’ for a charge to SDRT.</p><sup>10</sup><p>See STSM101010 for the meaning of a Collective Investment Scheme.</p><sup>11</sup><p>See STSM101020 and STSM101030 for the meaning of a Unit Trust.</p><sup>12</sup><p>See STSM082110 for meaning of a common investment arrangement.</p><sup>13</sup><p>See STSM082090 and STSM082100 for further guidance on a Pension Fund Pooling Vehicle.</p><sup>14</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>15</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
