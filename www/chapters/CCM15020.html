You must then terminate the claim as of the date they became a couple. This is because Section 3(4)(b) says that entitlement ceases from the point they were no longer eligible to claim as a single person. Where you establish the partner was always living with the customer you should terminate the claim as of the date it was made because it was never a valid claim. Although the claim must be terminated in this way we may decide not to recover all of the resulting overpayment - see CCM15500.</p><sup>11</sup><p>You might occasionally see the opposite situation where 2 people claim to be living as a couple when, in fact, they are only entitled to claim as single people. This is a much less common situation because there are fewer financial rewards. The criteria described in this chapter can still be used to decide whether they are single or a couple.</p><sup>12</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>13</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
