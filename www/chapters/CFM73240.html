In order to give a rule as to the time of payment of the interest, section 766 (5) treats the payments received by the lender under the structured finance arrangements as divided into principal and interest with the interest element of each payment treated as paid when the payment is received by the lender.</p><p>In a Condition A case, the reversal of the relevant effect in the case of the transferor partner by section 765 (2) (that is, restoring the tax charge on 100% of the alienated income) has no consequences for allocating that partner&#8217;s share of the finance charge. In particular the transferor partner will potentially get a deduction for the actual finance charge shown in its accounts. In a Condition B case that is true for all partners other than the lender. This exclusion for the lender is to ensure that in Condition B cases the lender does not obtain an increased share of the finance charge based on its increased profit share.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CFM73230:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CFM73250:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><h3>Deduction for finance charge</h3><p>The aim of the structured finance rules is to ensure that the tax system is neutral as between borrowing under a structured finance arrangement and other forms of borrowing.
