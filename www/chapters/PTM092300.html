For the purposes of this example, it has been assumed that Jacob&#8217;s rights when valued were within &#8220;HMRC limits&#8221;.

At that time, Jacob&#8217;s primary protection was worth &#163;3.6 million (standard lifetime allowance of &#163;1.8 million plus additional lifetime allowance factor of &#163;1.8 million). So Jacob used up 50 per cent of his personal lifetime allowance.</p><p>On 31 March 2014 Jacob took the rest of his benefits that were worth &#163;2 million. The standard lifetime allowance (SLA) in 2013-2014 was &#163;1.5 million. Jacob&#8217;s primary protection was then worth &#163;3.6 million (&#163;1.8 million plus a factor of 1). See above for how Jacob&#8217;s primary protection is calculated.</p><p>The amount of lifetime allowance used up by Jacob&#8217;s previous benefit crystallisation is found by multiplying the amount of that BCE (&#163;1.8 million) by the formula</p><p>SLA at time of current (2014) BCE/SLA at time of previous (2011) BCE</p><p>Where SLA is the standard lifetime allowance. So,</p><p>&#163;1.8 million x (&#163;1.5 million/&#163;1.8 million) = &#163;1.5 million.</p><p>Jacob has used up &#163;1.5 million lifetime allowance so has &#163;2.1 million available. In taking &#163;2 million Jacob has no lifetime allowance charge to pay. This is because the amount taken is within the amount of protection still available to him.</p><p>In describing how the individual gets a lifetime allowance that is greater than the standard lifetime allowance, it has been assumed that the individual&#8217;s rights when valued were within &#8220;HMRC limits&#8221;.

But an individual will have their primary protection reduced or lose it entirely if after 5 April 2006 they become subject to a pension debit as a result of a pension sharing order following their divorce.</p><p>When an individual with primary protection becomes subject to a pension debit, their primary protection factor is reduced. The value of the pension rights under primary protection are recalculated. This is done by reducing the amount &#8216;RR&#8217; (the value of the pension rights on 5 April 2006) in the formula &#8220;(RR - SLA)/SLA&#8221; by the amount of the pension debit. Where deducting the pension debit from &#8216;RR&#8217; results in &#8216;RR&#8217; being less than &#163;1.5 million, the individual will have lost primary protection entirely.</p><p>When an individual has become subject to a pension debit, they must notify HMRC. If primary protection has not been lost due to the pension debit, HMRC will issue a new certificate showing the reduced primary protection factor.</p><p>The reduced personal factor is then applied to all benefit crystallisation events that take place after the individual&#8217;s rights have been reduced by the pension debit. The reduction due to the pension debit occurs on the effective date of the pension sharing order. The Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 refers to the effective date as the transfer date. This will not necessarily be the same as the date that the individual&#8217;s rights in the arrangement(s) under the scheme are actually split.</p><p>Where a pension debit reduces an individual&#8217;s protected pension rights to a value below &#163;1.5 million, that individual will lose primary protection and revert to the standard lifetime allowance.</p><h3>Example</h3><p>Kevin has notified protected pension rights of &#163;3 million. His personal lifetime allowance is twice the standard lifetime allowance.</p><p>In June 2010, his protected pension rights were reduced by a pension debit of &#163;300,000. His &#163;3 million pension rights on 5 April 2006 are deemed to have reduced to &#163;2.7 million because of the &#163;300,000 pension debit. This causes a recalculation of his protected pension rights which reduces his personal lifetime allowance to 1.8 x the standard lifetime allowance. From 6 April 2012, the 1.8 factor applies to a lifetime allowance of &#163;1.8 million for so long as the lifetime allowance is below this figure.</p><p>Kevin crystallises his benefits in December 2015 when the standard lifetime allowance is &#163;1.5 million. Kevin can crystallise benefits valued up to &#163;3.24 million (&#163;1.8m x 1.8) without being subject to the lifetime allowance charge.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM092300:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Protection from the lifetime allowance charge for certain lump sum death benefits</h3><p>Paragraphs 11A - 11D Schedule 36 Finance Act 2004</p><p>Section 206 Finance Act 2004</p><p>The payment of a defined benefits lump sum death benefit or an uncrystallised funds lump sum death benefit where the member dies before reaching age 75 is a benefit crystallisation event.

This total does not include any lump sums that would exceed HMRC limits. It does not include any lump sums in respect of pension rights to which she is already entitled.</p><p>The lump sum rights arise under 3 schemes as follows:</p><p>Scheme A - a scheme that is not an occupational pension scheme provides a lump sum of &#163;500,000. This consists of &#163;200,000 payable as a return of funds and &#163;300,000 payable under a life assurance policy. The terms of the policy are varied significantly before Sangita&#8217;s death. Therefore only &#163;200,000 is taken into account initially.</p><p>Scheme B - an occupational pension scheme with less than 20 members on 5 April 2006. It provides a lump sum of &#163;500,000 under a life assurance policy. The terms of the policy are not varied and a sum assured is paid under the policy. Before death Sangita ceased to be employed by the sponsoring employer of the scheme. She has not been employed by a person connected with the sponsoring employer. Therefore the &#163;500,000 lump sum is not taken into account.</p><p>Scheme C - an occupational pension scheme with 100 members on 5 April 2006. It provides a lump sum of &#163;3 million. Variations to the life assurance policy do not affect the valuation of Sangita&#8217;s lump sum rights. Sangita was continuously employed by the sponsoring employer of the scheme from 5 April 2006 until her death. She had not become entitled to benefits from the scheme before her death. So &#163;3 million is taken into account initially.</p><p>At the initial stage only &#163;3.2 million is taken into account (being the &#163;3 million from scheme C and &#163;200,000 from scheme A).</p><p>Following Sangita&#8217;s death scheme C pays a lump sum death benefit of &#163;2.4 million and a dependant&#8217;s pension of &#163;60,000. The pension is paid instead of paying a further lump sum of &#163;1.2 million. The total potential lump sum payable from scheme C is &#163;3.6 million and the dependant&#8217;s pension proportion is one third.</p><p>Scheme A pays &#163;250,000 as a return of fund.

At that time, Jacob&#8217;s primary protection was worth &#163;3.6 million (standard lifetime allowance of &#163;1.8 million plus additional lifetime allowance factor of &#163;1.8 million). So Jacob used up 50 per cent of his personal lifetime allowance.</p><p>On 31 March 2014 Jacob took the rest of his benefits that were worth &#163;2 million. The standard lifetime allowance (SLA) in 2013-2014 was &#163;1.5 million. Jacob&#8217;s primary protection was then worth &#163;3.6 million (&#163;1.8 million plus a factor of 1). See above for how Jacob&#8217;s primary protection is calculated.</p><p>The amount of lifetime allowance used up by Jacob&#8217;s previous benefit crystallisation is found by multiplying the amount of that BCE (&#163;1.8 million) by the formula</p><p>SLA at time of current (2014) BCE/SLA at time of previous (2011) BCE</p><p>Where SLA is the standard lifetime allowance. So,</p><p>&#163;1.8 million x (&#163;1.5 million/&#163;1.8 million) = &#163;1.5 million.</p><p>Jacob has used up &#163;1.5 million lifetime allowance so has &#163;2.1 million available. In taking &#163;2 million Jacob has no lifetime allowance charge to pay.

But an individual will have their primary protection reduced or lose it entirely if after 5 April 2006 they become subject to a pension debit as a result of a pension sharing order following their divorce.</p><p>When an individual with primary protection becomes subject to a pension debit, their primary protection factor is reduced. The value of the pension rights under primary protection are recalculated. This is done by reducing the amount &#8216;RR&#8217; (the value of the pension rights on 5 April 2006) in the formula &#8220;(RR - SLA)/SLA&#8221; by the amount of the pension debit. Where deducting the pension debit from &#8216;RR&#8217; results in &#8216;RR&#8217; being less than &#163;1.5 million, the individual will have lost primary protection entirely.</p><p>When an individual has become subject to a pension debit, they must notify HMRC. If primary protection has not been lost due to the pension debit, HMRC will issue a new certificate showing the reduced primary protection factor.</p><p>The reduced personal factor is then applied to all benefit crystallisation events that take place after the individual&#8217;s rights have been reduced by the pension debit. The reduction due to the pension debit occurs on the effective date of the pension sharing order. The Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 refers to the effective date as the transfer date. This will not necessarily be the same as the date that the individual&#8217;s rights in the arrangement(s) under the scheme are actually split.</p><p>Where a pension debit reduces an individual&#8217;s protected pension rights to a value below &#163;1.5 million, that individual will lose primary protection and revert to the standard lifetime allowance.</p><h3>Example</h3><p>Kevin has notified protected pension rights of &#163;3 million. His personal lifetime allowance is twice the standard lifetime allowance.</p><p>In June 2010, his protected pension rights were reduced by a pension debit of &#163;300,000. His &#163;3 million pension rights on 5 April 2006 are deemed to have reduced to &#163;2.7 million because of the &#163;300,000 pension debit. This causes a recalculation of his protected pension rights which reduces his personal lifetime allowance to 1.8 x the standard lifetime allowance. From 6 April 2012, the 1.8 factor applies to a lifetime allowance of &#163;1.8 million for so long as the lifetime allowance is below this figure.</p><p>Kevin crystallises his benefits in December 2015 when the standard lifetime allowance is &#163;1.5 million. Kevin can crystallise benefits valued up to &#163;3.24 million (&#163;1.8m x 1.8) without being subject to the lifetime allowance charge.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM092300:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Protection from the lifetime allowance charge for certain lump sum death benefits</h3><p>Paragraphs 11A - 11D Schedule 36 Finance Act 2004</p><p>Section 206 Finance Act 2004</p><p>The payment of a defined benefits lump sum death benefit or an uncrystallised funds lump sum death benefit where the member dies before reaching age 75 is a benefit crystallisation event.

This total does not include any lump sums that would exceed HMRC limits. It does not include any lump sums in respect of pension rights to which she is already entitled.</p><p>The lump sum rights arise under 3 schemes as follows:</p><p>Scheme A - a scheme that is not an occupational pension scheme provides a lump sum of &#163;500,000. This consists of &#163;200,000 payable as a return of funds and &#163;300,000 payable under a life assurance policy. The terms of the policy are varied significantly before Sangita&#8217;s death. Therefore only &#163;200,000 is taken into account initially.</p><p>Scheme B - an occupational pension scheme with less than 20 members on 5 April 2006. It provides a lump sum of &#163;500,000 under a life assurance policy. The terms of the policy are not varied and a sum assured is paid under the policy. Before death Sangita ceased to be employed by the sponsoring employer of the scheme. She has not been employed by a person connected with the sponsoring employer. Therefore the &#163;500,000 lump sum is not taken into account.</p><p>Scheme C - an occupational pension scheme with 100 members on 5 April 2006. It provides a lump sum of &#163;3 million. Variations to the life assurance policy do not affect the valuation of Sangita&#8217;s lump sum rights. Sangita was continuously employed by the sponsoring employer of the scheme from 5 April 2006 until her death. She had not become entitled to benefits from the scheme before her death. So &#163;3 million is taken into account initially.</p><p>At the initial stage only &#163;3.2 million is taken into account (being the &#163;3 million from scheme C and &#163;200,000 from scheme A).</p><p>Following Sangita&#8217;s death scheme C pays a lump sum death benefit of &#163;2.4 million and a dependant&#8217;s pension of &#163;60,000. The pension is paid instead of paying a further lump sum of &#163;1.2 million. The total potential lump sum payable from scheme C is &#163;3.6 million and the dependant&#8217;s pension proportion is one third.</p><p>Scheme A pays &#163;250,000 as a return of fund. The entirety of the fund at the date of payment is used to provide the &#163;250,000 lump sum death benefit. There is no dependant&#8217;s pension proportion amount for scheme A.</p><p>Applying the dependant&#8217;s pension proportion to the value of the lump sum payable from scheme C on 5 April 2006 (&#163;3 million) gives a dependants&#8217; pension proportion amount of &#163;1 million. Subtracting this from the &#163;3.2 million (total amount of lump sums from scheme A and C at initial stage) gives a value of &#163;2.2 million for Sangita&#8217;s &#8216;pre-commencement rights to death benefits&#8217;.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM092200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM092400:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div></div></body></html>
