It should be sent to HMRC at the following address before the winding-up lump sum is paid. One declaration per employer listing all the members in respect of whom they give the undertaking at that time is sufficient.</p><p>Pension Schemes Services<nl /> HM Revenue &amp; Customs<nl /> Fitz Roy House<nl /> Castle Meadow Road<nl /> Nottingham<nl /> NG2 1BD</p><h3>What is meant by employer</h3><p>The contributions and undertaking rules set out above relate only to a current employer of the member who has, in the five years before the lump sum payment, made contributions in respect of the member to the scheme which is being wound up (whether or not the employer is still participating in the scheme). So if a member has a current employer who has never contributed to the scheme which is being wound up, then there is no need for that employer to give such an undertaking.</p><p>Employers who have contributed to other pension schemes but not to the pension scheme winding up are outside the definition of employer for this purpose, even if benefits under those other schemes have transferred across into the scheme that is winding up. As long as they have never contributed to the scheme which is winding up, they do not have to supply an undertaking.</p><h3>Partial winding-up</h3><p>A scheme may have several non-related employers participating in it on an industry-wide basis. Where an employer ceases to participate and leaves the scheme securing all the member&#8217;s rights from that employment outside the scheme, e.g. by transfer or annuity purchase, such a partial winding-up will constitute a scheme winding-up for the purposes of these provisions subject to all of the following circumstances being met:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>there is a registered pension scheme which is an occupational pension scheme,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the occupational pension scheme comprises a number of different sections,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the scheme rules provide for individual sections to be wound up,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>each section operates in respect of a particular employer participating in the scheme,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>if an employer has more than one section under a pension scheme all the sections relating to that employer must be wound up</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the winding-up means that the employer&#8217;s entire participation in the scheme ceases.</p></li><h3>Lifetime allowance</h3><p>The payment of a winding-up lump sum is not within the scope of BCE 6 and so does not trigger a lifetime allowance test, although as mentioned above, the member must have some lifetime allowance remaining at the time of payment for it to be treated as a winding-up lump sum.</p><p>Where the lump sum is being paid after age 75 from uncrystallised rights or funds, those rights or funds will have been tested against the member&#8217;s lifetime allowance under BCE 5 or BCE 5B as appropriate when the member reached age 75&#160;- see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM088650:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM088650</remotelink>. This BCE will have used up some or all of the member&#8217;s available lifetime allowance at that time. So, solely for the purposes of deciding whether the member satisfies the condition that they have available lifetime allowance, the fact that a BCE 5 or 5B has occurred is disregarded. This means that any lifetime allowance used up by that BCE does not count in calculating whether the member has available lifetime allowance. On the other hand, if the member has already taken benefits from the same or another arrangement under a registered pension scheme after reaching age 75 or some other event has occurred that would have been a BCE but for the fact that the event occurred on or after the member reaching age 75, then, solely for the purposes of calculating whether the member has available lifetime allowance, those events are treated as though they were BCEs, thus reducing the amount of lifetime allowance available at the time of the lump sum on scheme wind-up.</p><h3>Maximum that can be paid as a winding-up lump sum</h3><p>Paragraph 10(2) Schedule 29 Finance Act 2004</p><p>The maximum amount that can be treated as a winding up lump sum is &#163;18,000.</p><p>This limit applies on a scheme by scheme basis. Benefits held in other schemes, either crystallised or still accruing, do not need to be aggregated with the payment being made from the scheme that is winding up.</p><p>Where a payment is made which exceeds this limit, the excess will not be a winding-up lump sum.

The remaining part of the payment is taxed as pension income for the tax year the lump sum payment is made. Again, this taxable income is accountable through PAYE - see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM024600:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM024600</remotelink>.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM134500:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM134500</remotelink> explains how to value uncrystallised rights for these purposes.</p><h3>Operating PAYE on the payment</h3><p>Where the lump sum payment is in respect of a pension already in payment, use the PAYE code already in operation.</p><p>Where the pension being commuted was not already in payment, use the basic rate (BR) tax code</p><p>Guidance on how to operate PAYE correctly on these lump sums can be found in CWG2 - Employer&#8217;s further guide to PAYE and NICs.
