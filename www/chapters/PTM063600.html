There is no lower age limit for payment of a winding-up lump sum. The conditions that the lump sum must satisfy in order to qualify for tax treatment as a winding-up lump sum are that the lump sum:</p><sup>5</sup><p>does not exceed the maximum (see below)</p><sup>6</sup><p>is paid only where the member has available lifetime allowance (see below), and</p><sup>7</sup><p>extinguishes the member’s entitlement to benefits under the scheme (this means that any contingent pension on death must also be extinguished by the lump sum payment, as this entitlement forms part of the member’s rights in the scheme).</p><sup>8</sup><p>In addition, any employer of the member at the time the lump sum is paid who has made contributions under that scheme in the last five years in respect of the member who is to receive the winding-up lump sum:</p><sup>9</sup><p>is not making contributions under any other registered pension scheme in respect of the member, and</p><sup>10</sup><p>undertakes to HMRC not to make such contributions during the period of 1 year from the date the lump sum is paid.</p><sup>11</sup><p>The undertaking above should be in writing (there is no stock form for this) and confirm that the employer will meet the condition in paragraph 10(3)(c) of Schedule 29 to Finance Act 2004. It should be sent to HMRC at the following address before the winding-up lump sum is paid. One declaration per employer listing all the members in respect of whom they give the undertaking at that time is sufficient.</p><sup>12</sup><p>Pension Schemes Services</p><sup>13</sup><h3>What is meant by employer</h3><sup>14</sup><p>The contributions and undertaking rules set out above relate only to a current employer of the member who has, in the five years before the lump sum payment, made contributions in respect of the member to the scheme which is being wound up (whether or not the employer is still participating in the scheme). So if a member has a current employer who has never contributed to the scheme which is being wound up, then there is no need for that employer to give such an undertaking.</p><sup>15</sup><p>Employers who have contributed to other pension schemes but not to the pension scheme winding up are outside the definition of employer for this purpose, even if benefits under those other schemes have transferred across into the scheme that is winding up.

Where an employer ceases to participate and leaves the scheme securing all the member’s rights from that employment outside the scheme, e.g. by transfer or annuity purchase, such a partial winding-up will constitute a scheme winding-up for the purposes of these provisions subject to all of the following circumstances being met:</p><sup>18</sup><p>there is a registered pension scheme which is an occupational pension scheme,</p><sup>19</sup><p>the occupational pension scheme comprises a number of different sections,</p><sup>20</sup><p>the scheme rules provide for individual sections to be wound up,</p><sup>21</sup><p>each section operates in respect of a particular employer participating in the scheme,</p><sup>22</sup><p>if an employer has more than one section under a pension scheme all the sections relating to that employer must be wound up</p><sup>23</sup><p>the winding-up means that the employer’s entire participation in the scheme ceases.</p><sup>24</sup><h3>Lifetime allowance</h3><sup>25</sup><p>The payment of a winding-up lump sum is not within the scope of BCE 6 and so does not trigger a lifetime allowance test, although as mentioned above, the member must have some lifetime allowance remaining at the time of payment for it to be treated as a winding-up lump sum.</p><sup>26</sup><p>Where the lump sum is being paid after age 75 from uncrystallised rights or funds, those rights or funds will have been tested against the member’s lifetime allowance under BCE 5 or BCE 5B as appropriate when the member reached age 75 - see</p><sup>27</sup><h3>Maximum that can be paid as a winding-up lump sum</h3><sup>28</sup><p>Paragraph 10(2) Schedule 29 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>29</sup><p>The maximum amount that can be treated as a winding up lump sum is £18,000.</p><sup>30</sup><p>This limit applies on a scheme by scheme basis.
