Where payments on account are reduced and the final liability exceeds the total revised payments on account, the person is required to make a balancing payment of the difference, see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_SACM1005:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">SACM1005</remotelink>+.</p><p>A special provision changes the general rule at <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CH141120:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CH141120</remotelink>.
