It applies where a person makes a claim to reduce their payments on account that are due under self assessment, and then, because the claim was excessive, has to make a balancing payment as a result of their self-assessment for the year or a later discovery assessment. A balancing payment is the difference between a person’s liability for the year and the total of the payments on account and tax deducted at source for that year.</p><sup>3</sup><p>Late payment interest is charged in this situation because, if the person had paid the payments on account based on the previous year’s liability, or was more accurate with their estimation, then we would have received the tax sooner.
