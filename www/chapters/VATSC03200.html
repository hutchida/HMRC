Such a supply may be effected by selling something, by hiring or renting something or by someone doing something for someone else (a service).</p><sup>3</sup><p>Additionally, in certain circumstances, there can be a supply even if there is no consideration. There may also be instances where the transaction fails to be a supply or is disregarded for VAT purposes. You should therefore ascertain for a particular transaction:</p><sup>4</sup><p>whether there is consideration (for example money, but not exclusively money)</p><sup>5</sup><p>if there is no consideration whether the transaction is deemed by law to be a supply for VAT purposes</p><sup>6</sup><p>whether the transaction fails to be a supply or is a supply to be disregarded for VAT purposes.</p><sup>7</sup><p>VATSC03300, VATSC03400 and VATSC03500 give further background information on these points.</p><sup>8</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>9</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
