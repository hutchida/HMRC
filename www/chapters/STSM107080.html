This is the case whether the two AUTs share the same manager or trustee, or they have separate managers or trustees.</p><sup>6</sup><h4>Sub-funds of AUTs</h4><sup>7</sup><p>No SDRT charge arises where:</p><sup>8</sup><p>two-sub-funds of a common AUT amalgamate or merge;</p><sup>9</sup><p>one or more sub-funds of one AUT amalgamate/merge with a sub-fund of a different AUT with the same manager or trustee;</p><sup>10</sup><p>one or more sub-funds of one AUT merge with a sub-fund of a different AUT with a different manager or trustee.</p><sup>11</sup><p>Top of page</p><sup>12</sup><h4>Open-Ended Investment Companies (OEICs)</h4><sup>13</sup><p>No SDRT charge arises where an OEIC amalgamates/merges with another OEIC. This is the case whether they have the same authorised corporate director or depository, or different authorised corporate directors or depositories.</p><sup>14</sup><h4>Sub-funds of OEICs</h4><sup>15</sup><p>No SDRT charge arises where:</p><sup>16</sup><p>two or more sub-funds of a common OEIC amalgamate/merge;</p><sup>17</sup><p>one or more sub-funds of one OEIC merge with a sub-fund of a different OEIC with the same authorised corporate director or depository;</p><sup>18</sup><p>one or more sub-funds of one OEIC amalgamate/merge with a sub-fund of a different OEIC with a different authorised corporate director or depository.</p><sup>19</sup><p>Top of page</p><sup>20</sup><h4>Partitions</h4><sup>21</sup><p>No SDRT charge arises where:</p><sup>22</sup><p>part of the investments of an AUT or a sub-fund of an AUT are amalgamated/merged with the investments of another AUT or a sub-fund of that AUT; or</p><sup>23</sup><p>part of the investments of an OEIC or a sub-fund of an OEIC are amalgamated/merged with the investments of another OEIC or a sub-fund of that OEIC.</p><sup>24</sup><p>Top of page</p><sup>25</sup><h4>Reconstructions</h4><sup>26</sup><p>No SDRT charge arises where:</p><sup>27</sup><p>A sub-fund of an AUT or OEIC is reconstructed as a separate AUT or OEIC with the same manager, trustee or depository or different managers, trustees or depositories;</p><sup>28</sup><p>A sub-fund of an AUT or OEIC is reconstructed as a sub-fund of a separate AUT or OEIC with the same manager, trustee or depository or different managers, trustees or depositories;</p><sup>29</sup><p>The investments of an AUT or OEIC, or a sub-fund of an AUT or OEIC, are split between separate AUTs and OEICs, or separate sub-funds of an AUT or OEIC, with the same manager, trustee or depository or different managers, trustees or depositories.</p><sup>30</sup><p>Transactions other than those listed above will continue to be dealt with by HMRC on a case-by-case basis. In these situations, full details of the transaction, along with copy documentation in support must be sent to HMRC Stamp Taxes. Where doubt exists as to whether a transaction actually takes place under a scheme of arrangement, the case must be submitted to Stamp Taxes - Policy for consideration.</p><sup>31</sup><p>Top of page</p><sup>32</sup><h4>SDRT: Schedule 19 Finance Act 1999</h4><sup>33</sup><p>No charge to SDRT arises under paragraph 2 of FA99SCH19 in the case of conversions, amalgamations/mergers, partitions and reconstructions of AUTs or OEICs, where units or shares in the discontinuing scheme are cancelled and extinguished by the manager, to allow the scheme investments to be transferred to the continuing scheme in accordance with the terms of a scheme of arrangement. This is because the unit or shareholders in the discontinuing scheme do not authorise or require the trustee or manager of that scheme to treat them as no longer interested in the units or shares.</p><sup>34</sup><p>Similarly, the issue of units or OEIC shares by the continuing scheme in accordance with the terms of a scheme of arrangement is not regarded as being an issue for the purposes of FA99/SCH19.</p><sup>35</sup><p>See STSM101030 for the meaning of an authorised unit trust.</p><sup>36</sup><p>See STSM101050 for the meaning of an Open-Ended Investment Company.</p><sup>37</sup><p>See STSM107050 for stamp implications on the conversion of an authorised unit trust to an Open-Ended Investment Company.</p><sup>38</sup><p>See STSM107060 for stamp implications on the amalgamation of an authorised unit trust to an Open-Ended Investment Company.</p><sup>39</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>40</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
