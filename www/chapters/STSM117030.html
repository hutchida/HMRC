On 2 January, the investor and issuer of the forwards contract agree that the price of the shares will be fixed at the London Stock Exchange closing market value of the underlying shares on 31 January. On placing and agreeing the share order on 2 January with a deposit, the investor is obligated to take-up and pay for the underlying shares on delivery of the shares in three months time. If, at the time of settlement, the issuer of the forwards contract is offering the same company X shares at a lower share price than the price set at 31 January, it does not matter. The share price the investor must pay to the broker dealer on delivery of company X shares is the agreed price based on the valuation of the shares on 31 January.
