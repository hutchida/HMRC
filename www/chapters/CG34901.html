The gains of that year are apportioned and attributed as before because Mrs B had an interest in the settlement at some time during the year. The losses of 1989-90 and the gains of 1990-91 are apportioned in the same way, and the net gains of £25 for 1990-91 are attributed to A.</p><sup>1</sup><p>There can be no attribution to B in 1990-91 because neither he nor his spouse has an interest in the settlement in that year. Accordingly the gains on the assets deriving from the property provided by B are assessable on the trustees and the trustees can claim the annual exemption due to them. If this exceeds the gains of 1990-91 (£375), the losses brought forward of £300 do not need to be set against those gains, see CG18030. The losses of £300 will instead be carried forward and set against subsequent gains accruing on disposals of the settled property which derives from B, again making a just apportionment of the trust gains.</p><sup>2</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>3</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
