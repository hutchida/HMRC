In a period of generally rising oil price, contracts for delivery in M would initially at least, be made for AL sales, as the AL price would probably be lower than the eventual NAL price. If the market price continued to rise, and as the eventual TRP became clearer, contracts would continue to be made for AL sales until the companies&#8217; traders thought that the market price was greater than the eventual TRP. At this point contracts would be made for NAL sales. In the early stages of the VRP, the market price and the evolving TRP (based upon the known market prices in the VRP up to the then current date) would move in relation to each other, with sometimes market price being greater, sometimes evolving TRP being greater. Any decision about how to sell would depend critically upon the trader&#8217;s view of the market price in what was left of the VRP.
