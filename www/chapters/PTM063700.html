However, there are exceptions, for example, a payment is made into the originating pension scheme at a later date which relates to a member who previously transferred out. An example of this would be where dividends or other structured payments are received from an investment that had related to the transferring member. Late payments might also be received from an insurance company, say, in the case of unit-pricing problems relating to a policy investment under the scheme, or from a fund manager, or the receipt of a payment may have been overlooked.</p><p>A scheme might also find that it holds extra rights for the member without there actually being a payment-in, for example some rights that, for whatever reason, had not been correctly identified at the time of the transfer, perhaps where there had been a valuation error in a money purchase arrangement, which had caused an investment that provided part of the transfer value to be undervalued. A later correction in the valuation could result in there being further rights in the scheme relating to the member who had transferred out.</p><p>Many of the above kinds of situation, which cause there to be further member rights under an arrangement in the scheme, will be classed under the tax rules as a &#8216;relevant accretion&#8217;.

There will invariably be a time gap between the member requesting/being offered a small lump payment and the lump sum being paid. Any investment growth, contributions paid or additional benefit accrual etc. in the intervening period will count towards the limit. So no payment can be made under regulation 11A where, for example, a lump sum of &#163;9,990 is offered on 6 June 2014 but subsequent investment growth results in the fund increasing to &#163;10,010 by 6 July 2014.</p><p>The last condition means that an individual can be given more than one small lump sum each not exceeding the limit that applied at the time the lump sum was paid, if all the other conditions are met. It should be noted that Regulation 11A applies at arrangement level rather than at scheme level. So the payments can be made from two/three separate registered pension schemes or from the same scheme where the payments are made from two/three different arrangements under that scheme.</p><p>As one of the conditions is that the payment extinguishes the member&#8217;s entitlement to benefits under the arrangement from which the payment is made but not necessarily their entitlement under the scheme as a whole, a member can take a small lump sum under Regulation 11A even though they may still have an entitlement to benefits under another arrangement under that scheme.</p><p>A member may have a large number of arrangements (say 100 or 1000) under the same registered pension scheme where each arrangement contains well under the commutation limit under this regulation. In such cases, subject to what the scheme rules allow, these funds may be consolidated either by merging arrangements into a smaller number of arrangements or by a transfer of funds between multiple arrangements to allow the maximum small pot to be taken from either one or each of two/three arrangements under the scheme. A &#8216;reshaping&#8217; of existing arrangements in this way either by way of merging multiple arrangements or internal &#8220;transfers&#8221; of funds between multiple arrangements in the same scheme will not involve the setting up of a new arrangement with potential consequences for members who have valid enhanced protection, fixed protection or fixed protection 2014 (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM091000:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM091000</remotelink>).</p><p>However, where a member has funds in excess of the limit in an existing single arrangement some of which are then moved into arrangements set up for the purpose of allowing a member to take one or two/three small lump sum payments under Regulation 11A, this will involve the setting up of one or more new arrangements with potential consequences for members who have valid enhanced protection, fixed protection, fixed protection 2014 or fixed protection 2016.</p><p>Lump sum payments can be made under Regulation 11A regardless of the individual&#8217;s total pension savings in registered pension schemes and can be made in addition to any trivial commutation lump sum payment the individual may receive.

Alternatively, if the payment represents crystallised rights, all of the payment is chargeable to income tax as pension income. Where the payment represents a mixture of both uncrystallised and crystallised benefit rights only 25% of the part of the payment relating to the uncrystallised rights can be paid free of income tax.</p><p>When the one-off payment is made to someone other than the member, such as when the payment is made after the death of the member, the payment itself is not classed as either a trivial commutation lump sum, nor is it classed as a trivial commutation lump sum death benefit.

Basically, this means that in such circumstances, all of the payment is chargeable to income tax as pension income.</p><p>In all cases, the payer of the one-off lump sum must operate PAYE to account for the tax due on as much of the payment as is subject to income tax - as explained above.

The conditions that need to be met instead, for such a small lump sum to be an authorised member payment under Regulation 11A, are that:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the payment is made on or after 6 April 2012, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the payment is made to a member who has reached the age of 55 or is entitled to take their benefits before age 55 because they either meet the ill-health condition (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM062100:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM062100</remotelink>) or have a protected pension age (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM062210:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM062210</remotelink>), and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the &#8216;small lump sum&#8217; payment does not exceed (for a payment made before 27 March 2014) &#163;2,000 or (for a payment made on or after 27 March 2014) &#163;10,000, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the payment extinguishes the member&#8217;s entitlement to benefits under the arrangement , and except that from 6 April 2015 an annuity already in payment by the scheme may continue in payment provided the member has not already received a payment by that scheme under any of regulations 11, 11A and 12</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>for a payment made before 27 March 2014, the member has not previously received more than one payment under Regulation 11A, or for a payment made on or after 27 March 2014, the member has not previously received more than two payments under Regulation 11A.</p></li><p>The monetary limit applies to the actual lump sum paid. There will invariably be a time gap between the member requesting/being offered a small lump payment and the lump sum being paid. Any investment growth, contributions paid or additional benefit accrual etc. in the intervening period will count towards the limit. So no payment can be made under regulation 11A where, for example, a lump sum of &#163;9,990 is offered on 6 June 2014 but subsequent investment growth results in the fund increasing to &#163;10,010 by 6 July 2014.</p><p>The last condition means that an individual can be given more than one small lump sum each not exceeding the limit that applied at the time the lump sum was paid, if all the other conditions are met. It should be noted that Regulation 11A applies at arrangement level rather than at scheme level. So the payments can be made from two/three separate registered pension schemes or from the same scheme where the payments are made from two/three different arrangements under that scheme.</p><p>As one of the conditions is that the payment extinguishes the member&#8217;s entitlement to benefits under the arrangement from which the payment is made but not necessarily their entitlement under the scheme as a whole, a member can take a small lump sum under Regulation 11A even though they may still have an entitlement to benefits under another arrangement under that scheme.</p><p>A member may have a large number of arrangements (say 100 or 1000) under the same registered pension scheme where each arrangement contains well under the commutation limit under this regulation. In such cases, subject to what the scheme rules allow, these funds may be consolidated either by merging arrangements into a smaller number of arrangements or by a transfer of funds between multiple arrangements to allow the maximum small pot to be taken from either one or each of two/three arrangements under the scheme. A &#8216;reshaping&#8217; of existing arrangements in this way either by way of merging multiple arrangements or internal &#8220;transfers&#8221; of funds between multiple arrangements in the same scheme will not involve the setting up of a new arrangement with potential consequences for members who have valid enhanced protection, fixed protection or fixed protection 2014 (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM091000:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM091000</remotelink>).</p><p>However, where a member has funds in excess of the limit in an existing single arrangement some of which are then moved into arrangements set up for the purpose of allowing a member to take one or two/three small lump sum payments under Regulation 11A, this will involve the setting up of one or more new arrangements with potential consequences for members who have valid enhanced protection, fixed protection, fixed protection 2014 or fixed protection 2016.</p><p>Lump sum payments can be made under Regulation 11A regardless of the individual&#8217;s total pension savings in registered pension schemes and can be made in addition to any trivial commutation lump sum payment the individual may receive. (The requirements for a trivial commutation lump sum are set out in <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM063500:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM063500</remotelink> onwards.)</p><p>An individual may in addition have small pension pots in one or more schemes which qualify as an occupational pension scheme or a public service pension scheme. Where this is the case, they may also be able to commute those small pension pots under Regulation 11 or Regulation 12.

The circumstances under which such one-off payments can qualify as authorised member payments are set out earlier on this page.</p><p>Where a member receives one of these small lump sum payments, the payment itself is not classed as a trivial commutation lump sum. However, the payment does get taxed in the same way as a trivial commutation lump sum would be.</p><p>This means that where the payment represents uncrystallised benefit rights, 25% of the payment is free of income tax, and the balance of the payment is chargeable to income tax as pension income. Alternatively, if the payment represents crystallised rights, all of the payment is chargeable to income tax as pension income. Where the payment represents a mixture of both uncrystallised and crystallised benefit rights only 25% of the part of the payment relating to the uncrystallised rights can be paid free of income tax.</p><p>When the one-off payment is made to someone other than the member, such as when the payment is made after the death of the member, the payment itself is not classed as either a trivial commutation lump sum, nor is it classed as a trivial commutation lump sum death benefit. However, the payment does get taxed in the same way as a trivial commutation lump sum death benefit would be. Basically, this means that in such circumstances, all of the payment is chargeable to income tax as pension income.</p><p>In all cases, the payer of the one-off lump sum must operate PAYE to account for the tax due on as much of the payment as is subject to income tax - as explained above. The operation of PAYE is outside the scope of this manual - see section 23 of the gov.uk guidance CWG2 - Employer&#8217;s further guide to PAYE and NICs.
