This applies up to a maximum £1000 for Basic Rate customers and £500 for Higher Rate customers. The PSA does not apply to savings income received by Additional Rate customers.</p><sup>199</sup><p>For 2016-17 tax year only, PSA is shown as an allowance but for 2017-18 onwards, PSA is used to reduce the amount of untaxed interest, applying tax to interest remaining after any allowances: the total Liability Calculation within the Tax Code Calculation screen will display the value of PSA awarded at 0%.</p><sup>200</sup><p>Note: PSA is in addition to the Starter Savings Rate (SSR) which allows low income earners to receive up to £5,000 tax-free Savings Interest. PSA is unaffected by the Scottish Rate of Income Tax and is applied at the same rate for all taxpayers across the UK.</p><sup>201</sup><p>With the introduction of PSA from 6 April 2016 the system for deducting tax at source from savings income has been stopped, though banks and building societies continue to provide HMRC with details of gross untaxed savings income. HMRC then makes provision for those taxpayers who are still liable for tax on savings income, adjusting tax codes for PAYE customers including PAYE-SA customers choosing to pay this way.</p><sup>202</sup><p>Where customers are still liable for tax after PSA and unused personal allowances are applied, savings income is pre-populated into IABD as a gross amount in Untaxed Interest.</p><sup>203</sup><p>A new NPS IABD entry for the value of the Personal Savings Allowance is used for calculation of the allowance, and any tax liability is displayed in the Total Liability Calculation screen as ‘Personal Savings Allowance’. Where untaxed interest is below the limit, the Personal Savings Allowance amount included for annual coding is displayed as the actual amount of savings income, up to a maximum of £1000 (BR) or £500 (HR).</p><sup>204</sup><p>Customers may contact HMRC to change the amount of untaxed interest because they believe it is incorrect. Contact History notes are pre-populated with a secure breakdown of encrypted account information so users can confirm and correct IABD where necessary.</p><sup>205</sup><p>When talking to customers, users should advise them to check their records and if necessary their Bank or Building Society account information and that if we later find they have incorrectly declared the interest, we may take action to collect any additional tax due.</p><sup>206</sup><p>PAYE130010 and action guide ‘IABD - change in financial circumstances’ on the Personal Tax Operations Guidance hub explain how to update Untaxed Interest in NPD IABD.</p><sup>207</sup><p>Every time information is recorded and submitted, the system automatically looks at the changes made to a record and determine if</p><sup>208</sup><p>A coding calculation is required</p><sup>209</sup><p>An in year calculation is required</p><sup>210</sup><p>Or</p><sup>211</sup><p>An end of year calculation is required</p><sup>212</sup><p>Top of page</p><sup>213</sup><h4>Retirement Annuity Payments</h4><sup>214</sup><p>Enter the gross amount of the payment</p><sup>215</sup><p>To calculate the amount due see ‘Allowances and Reliefs’ at PAYE11110</p><sup>216</sup><p>You should select ‘YES’ from the Eligible for Pension Plan Relief field</p><sup>217</sup><p>You should enter the Allowance cessation date - this must be in the format DD/MM/CCYY</p><sup>218</sup><h4>Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme</h4><sup>219</sup><p>The Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) was introduced in April 2012 to run alongside the existing Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) (PAYE10045).
