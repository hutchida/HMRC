They therefore apply for all periods of account of a worldwide group starting on or after that date. For groups that have a straddling period of account, this period is treated as split into two notional periods of account.</p><sup>2</sup><p>The Worldwide Debt Cap rules are repealed with effect from 1 April 2017. The rules governing the repeal mirror the commencement rules in relation to straddling periods.</p><sup>3</sup><p>In addition, the following rules apply on transition to the new corporate interest restriction regime:</p><sup>4</sup><p>There are a number of extended time limits that apply for the first year of the rules.</p><sup>5</sup><p>Certain amounts in respect of previous accounting and tax changes are excluded from the regime.</p><sup>6</sup><p>Certain adjustments are made to the group’s financial statements in two situations to address group mismatches.</p><sup>7</sup><p>Groups may make an election to be treated, for the purposes of these rules, as if they had elected into regulations 7, 8 and 9 of the Disregard Regulations.</p><sup>8</sup><p>Existing guarantees as at 1 April 2017 are grandfathered such that they do not themselves cause debt to be related party debt. Likewise, any finance lease in existence as at 1 April 2017 is not considered to be a related party debt.</p><sup>9</sup><p>Transitional infrastructure rules which can apply to accounting periods beginning before 1 April 2018 give the business time to restructure if necessary to qualify for the main infrastructure rules. In addition, there is limited grandfathering of loans funding assets that have a highly predictable income based on qualifying public contracts.</p><sup>10</sup><p>Specific provisions limit the effect of the regime anti avoidance rule for certain restructurings in connection with commencement.</p><sup>11</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
