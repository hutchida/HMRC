In the opinion of the Tribunal, there were two separate entities of</p><sup>1</sup><p>a sole proprietor supplying wet sales, and</p><sup>2</sup><p>a second sole proprietor providing catering.</p><sup>3</sup><p>Despite substantial evidence indicating a single business, the Tribunal placed considerable weight on the tradersâ€™ intention when reaching its decision. It also mentioned in its decision that, where there is a formal relationship between the parties, there may be an acceptable level of informality between the businesses.</p><sup>4</sup><p>This decision clarifies that public perception carries little weight when deciding whether there is only one business.</p><sup>5</sup><p> Previous page</p></div></body></html>
