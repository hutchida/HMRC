The embedded derivative (the conversion or exchange rights or obligations in the case of a convertible or exchangeable security, or the asset link rights in the case of an asset linked security) within a hybrid financial instrument is measured at fair value. The fair value of the derivative component is determined separately using an appropriate valuation model. The different between the fair value of the derivative and the fair value of the contract as a whole is allocated to the loan host contract (that is, the loan host contract is valued as a residual amount).</p><sup>4</sup><p>If, however, it is impossible to reliably value the derivative as a separate instrument (for example, because the derivative is based on unquoted shares), its fair value is taken as being the difference between the fair value of the whole instrument and the fair value of the loan component.</p><sup>5</sup><p>The accounting treatment adopted by the issuer of a compound financial instrument - a financial liability plus an equity component - is slightly different.
