In the former, ownership of the goods transfers or is intended to transfer at some point and this is therefore a supply of goods (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_VATSC70000:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">VATSC70000</remotelink>) with connected supplies of credit in some instances.

The supply of the goods or services is taxable according to their liability and normal tax point rules will apply.</p><h3>Third-party financed credit</h3><p>This is where the supplier makes a supply to the customer but receives payment from a finance company. At the same time, the customer enters an agreement with the finance company for the loan and repayment of the money. In day-to-day commerce - particularly retailing - this is the more common type of credit arrangement.</p><h3>Interest-free credit</h3><p>Where a retailer or third party provides credit and allows the customer to repay only the exact amount loaned this is termed &#8216;interest-free&#8217;.</p><p>The VAT treatment of this form of credit sale has been determined by the ECJ judgment in the case of Primback Ltd (&#8216;Primback&#8217; - Case C-34/99 ([2001] STC 803).</p><p>Primback, a furniture retailer, advertised goods on interest free credit terms. On purchasing the goods, the customer completed a written agreement with a finance company for a loan of the price of the goods (less any deposit). Under this agreement the amount of the loan was to be paid on the customer&#8217;s behalf to Primback, and was to be repaid by the customer to the finance company in instalments, but without any additional charge for interest. For example, where goods were sold for &#163;600 on six months interest free credit terms, then, as far as the customer was concerned, he merely paid 6 instalments of &#163;100 to the finance company.</p><p>Under separate arrangements between the finance company and Primback, however, the finance company made a deduction from the amount forwarded to Primback, which accordingly received only, say &#163;560, not the full amount of &#163;600. The Commissioners regarded this deduction as third party consideration, paid by Primback for the loan made to the customer, and that output tax on &#163;600 was due.</p><p>The ECJ found that because there is no consideration, in the form of interest, paid by the consumer on an interest-free loan, there is no supply for VAT purposes. It also found that the consideration for the taxable goods was the full amount payable by the purchaser.</p><h3>Disclosure</h3><p>For the purposes of item 3, which states that any separate charge made must be disclosed to the recipient of the supply of goods, the disclosure can be made either in writing or orally, and either clearly or obliquely.
