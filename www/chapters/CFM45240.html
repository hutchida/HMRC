The logic is that a banking group is either trading or investing in relation to the shares it acquires.</p><sup>14</sup><p>If it can be shown that a share is being used to get around CTA09/S130, then (provided the other conditions are met) the redemption return condition will apply to treat the share as a creditor loan relationship. If that cannot be shown, but the investing company is part of a banking group, then S530 will still apply unless the investing company can show that it acquired the share in the ordinary course of an investment business. Note that the onus is on the investing company to demonstrate that fact.</p><sup>15</sup><p>Although the wording in CTA09/S531(3) refers to ‘immediately before that time’ (i.e. the time the share was acquired by the investing company), HMRC staff should accept that the test is met (including the ‘in the ordinary course of that business’ requirement) where the share is the first investment made by a company provided that they are satisfied the company has embarked on genuine investment business and the share is not being used to disguise lending arrangements. This includes cases where the company only intends to acquire a single investment.</p><sup>16</sup><p>In applying this test, it is not a requirement that a company’s whole business consists in making and holding investments (CTA09/S531(3) refers to ‘some or all of its business’).
