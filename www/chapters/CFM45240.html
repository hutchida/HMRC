Circumvention of S130 is to be treated as an unallowable purpose, and in deciding whether that test is passed, there is a special rule for companies which are part of banking groups.

But that might not be the case where, for instance, a tax advantage arose as a result of one party being a financial trader. Each case must be considered on its own facts.</p><h3>Banking groups: special rule</h3><p>CTA09/S531(2) to (4) gives the special rule for banking groups. It provides that a company shall be taken to have the purpose, or one of the main purposes, of circumventing CTA09/S130 if the investing company was an associated company of a bank at the time when it acquired the share, unless the investing company shows that -</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>immediately before that time, some or all of its business consisted in making and holding investments, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>it acquired the share in the ordinary course of that business.</p></li><p>A &#8216;bank&#8217; has the meaning given by ICTA88/S840A, and associated company means a company within the same group within the meaning given by ICTA88/S413 (3)(a).</p><p>The reason for this additional rule is that banking groups have undertaken numerous and varied schemes to convert an interest lending return into something else for tax purposes, and so this rule provides additional safeguards. The logic is that a banking group is either trading or investing in relation to the shares it acquires.</p><p>If it can be shown that a share is being used to get around CTA09/S130, then (provided the other conditions are met) the redemption return condition will apply to treat the share as a creditor loan relationship. If that cannot be shown, but the investing company is part of a banking group, then S530 will still apply unless the investing company can show that it acquired the share in the ordinary course of an investment business. Note that the onus is on the investing company to demonstrate that fact.</p><p>Although the wording in CTA09/S531(3) refers to &#8216;immediately before that time&#8217; (i.e. the time the share was acquired by the investing company), HMRC staff should accept that the test is met (including the &#8216;in the ordinary course of that business&#8217; requirement) where the share is the first investment made by a company provided that they are satisfied the company has embarked on genuine investment business and the share is not being used to disguise lending arrangements. This includes cases where the company only intends to acquire a single investment.</p><p>In applying this test, it is not a requirement that a company&#8217;s whole business consists in making and holding investments (CTA09/S531(3) refers to &#8216;some or all of its business&#8217;). So it is possible for a financial trader such as a bank to hold a share as an investment. This will be a question of fact, but shares in subsidiaries are unlikely to be trading assets.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CFM45230:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CFM45250:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><h3>Unallowable purpose test</h3><p>This guidance applies to companies that hold shares up to 21 April 2009</p><p>In addition to the two lets outs from the redemption return condition explained in <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_CFM45230:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CFM45230</remotelink>, CTA09/S531 provides a third let out where a company&#8217;s purpose in acquiring a share is not an unallowable purpose.
