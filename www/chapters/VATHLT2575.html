We are only concerned with its supplies to the Trusts. These are to a large extent, though not exclusively, supplies of pathology services &#8211; testing samples of body fluid, tissue, etc. and communicating the results to the Trusts for the purposes of the supply of services of medical care by the Trusts or other health professionals to patients. The first issue is whether the supplies of pathology services are exempt from VAT as themselves constituting &#8216;medical care&#8217; as that expression has been construed by the European Court of Justice (&#8216;CJEU&#8217;)</p></li><p>&#160;</p><li><lilabel>1</lilabel><p>The second issue is whether, even if the supplies are of medical care by a recognised body, HMRC are (as GSTS contends) under an EU law obligation to achieve the result that the supplies are not exempt, either by applying conditions which article 133 of Directive 2006/112 allows Member States to impose and GSTS does not satisfy or by declining to recognise GSTS as a medical establishment for the purposes of the Directive. The basis of the argument is (a) that in the particular circumstances prevailing in the United Kingdom, where s 41 of the Act enables NHS Trusts to reclaim VAT paid out by them for laboratory services, treatment of GSTS as taxable would reduce the overall tax burden by enabling GSTS to recover its input VAT and (b) that the purpose of these exemptions, to which HMRC are under a duty to give effect, is to reduce the VAT burden on medical care; in the circumstances at issue, that is achieved by withholding exemption. Our conclusions on this are that the discretion which the Directive leaves to Member States has been exercised in the United Kingdom in the framing of the relevant provisions of the VAT Act 1994, which HMRC have no residual discretion to over-ride, and that EU law does not in any event impose a duty on Member States to make exemption unavailable to a taxpayer on the grounds that standard-rated treatment would 5 be more advantageous for it.</p></li><p>&#160;</p><p>Medical care</p><p>&#160;</p><p>111. We reject Ms Whipple&#8217;s submission that GSTS&#8217;s supplies do not have a &#8216;therapeutic purpose&#8217; within the meaning of the case-law. On the contrary, we find that they do. The function of the &#8216;therapeutic purpose&#8217; test enunciated in D v W, Unterpertinger and d&#8217;Ambrumenil is to distinguish between medical activities undertaken for the purpose of protecting, maintaining or restoring human health from those undertaken for a different purpose such as informing a judicial or other decision of a non-medical character. It is not a test aimed at distinguishing between &#8216;medical care&#8217; and &#8216;closely related activities&#8217;. Ms Whipple would be right to say that GSTS&#8217;s activities do not in themselves have the effect of protecting, maintaining or restoring health &#8211; it is the use that clinicians make of them that does that &#8211; but they have that purpose since they are supplied in order to be used in that way. We appreciate that in this respect we are differing from the approach taken by the Tribunal in In Health at paragraph 53 of their Decision.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>112. That leaves the question of whether pathology testing is, as a matter of EU law,</p><p>&#8216;medical care&#8217; or a &#8216;closely related activity&#8217;. GSTS&#8217;s difficulty here is that LuP holds that an &#8216;upstream&#8217; supply of pathology testing is medical care &#8211; an argument to the contrary being specifically rejected at paragraph 37 of the judgment) &#8211; and Verigen holds that an upstream supply of cell culturing &#8211; another laboratory activity &#8211; is medical care as well. Ms Whipple submitted that a distinguishing feature of Verigen was that cells cultured by Verigen from the patient&#8217;s cartilage were re-injected into the body of the patient, but we cannot see that that is a relevant distinction. In the present case material from the patient&#8217;s body is used to produce not a physical substance of value in his treatment but information of value in his treatment. In both cases the connection of the activity with medical care is that it aids the clinician in that task. </p><p>&#160;</p><p>This Guidance confirms that:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>state-regulated pathology laboratories are &#8216;qualifying health institutions&#8217;, for the purposes of Item 4 of the health exemption (Group 7 to Schedule 9 of the VAT Act 1994).</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>laboratories are providing exempt medical services when their services are connected with the protection, maintenance or restoration of the health of an individual</p></li><h3>Why are state-regulated pathology laboratories &#8216;qualifying health institutions?&#8217;</h3><p>An institution is &#8216;state-regulated&#8217; if it is approved, licensed, registered or exempted from registration by any Minister or other authority pursuant to legislation.
