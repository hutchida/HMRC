EES increases the value of unused R&amp;D allowances on qualifying E&amp;A expenditure carried forward from one period to another by a compound 6% a year.

EES can be claimed in respect of not more than 6 accounting periods, but these need not be consecutive (<remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_OT26085:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">OT26085</remotelink>).</p><p>EES cannot be claimed on qualifying E&amp;A expenditure to the extent that there are ring fence profits arising to another company in the group or profits of an earlier period against which losses attributable to the expenditure could be set.

The post-commencement expenditure is also pooled and the supplement is carried forward as a trading loss.
