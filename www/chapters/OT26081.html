EES increases the value of unused R&amp;D allowances on qualifying E&amp;A expenditure carried forward from one period to another by a compound 6% a year. The supplement is also available on unused EES carried forwards. EES can be claimed in respect of not more than 6 accounting periods, but these need not be consecutive (OT26085).</p><sup>5</sup><p>EES cannot be claimed on qualifying E&amp;A expenditure to the extent that there are ring fence profits arising to another company in the group or profits of an earlier period against which losses attributable to the expenditure could be set.

Pre-trading expenditure is pooled and cumulative EES can be claimed on the pooled expenditure in the first year of trading. These pre-commencement rules also contain special provisions to deal with the consequences of the disposal of a licence interest before trading begins. The post-commencement expenditure is also pooled and the supplement is carried forward as a trading loss. These rules have to accommodate losses, including losses attributable to qualifying E&amp;A expenditure and EES that may be set against other profits.</p></div></div></body></html>
