So an OEIC (or sub-fund of an OEIC) with both income and accumulation shares should calculate the liability to SDRT for a given charging period for the OEIC as a whole. An Authorised Corporate Director with income and accumulation shares will probably find it most natural to restate accumulation shares in terms of notional income shares for this purpose. A record of the conversion calculations will need to be kept for audit purposes.</p><sup>2</sup><p>But OEICs which have only accumulation shares will, of course, have no need to restate them as notional income shares.</p><sup>3</sup><p>Switches between income and accumulation shares are not to be treated as surrenders under Paragraph 2 FA99/SCH19 but as a type of consolidation or subdivision of shares. A charge to SDRT does not arise on a switch between these types of shares; accordingly, these switches should not be included in I or S as defined in Paragraph 4(3).</p><sup>4</sup><p>See STSM101050 for the meaning of an open-ended investment company.</p><sup>5</sup><p>See STSM104020 for the meaning of I/S as outlined in paragraph 4(3) FA99/SCH19.</p><sup>6</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>7</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
