In brief, a third-party paid an insurer to provide cover to their customer; the payment had previously been treated as a taxable insurance premium and IPT accounted for. At the time payment was made the insured was unknown to the insurer and cover under the policy commenced at some point in the future. Under the proposed scheme, the insurer claimed to be providing the insurance free of charge, under a deed and that the payment from the third-party was not a premium received under a taxable insurance contract, but was instead a payment for the &#8216;right to require&#8217; the insurer to provide the insurance to the customer. As such they suggested that the payment was not subject to IPT. Although we considered that the scheme did not achieve its intended aim, i.e. we still thought that the payment was premium received under the contract of insurance, the Budget 2007 inserted a new Section - 72(1)(B) into the Finance Act 94:</p><p>S72(1)(B) Where,</p><p>(a) an amount is charged (to the insured or any other person) in respect of the acquisition of a right (whether of the insured or any other person) to require the insurer to provide, or offer to provide, any of the cover included in a taxable insurance contract, and </p><p>(b) any payment in respect of that amount is not regarded as a payment received under that contract by the insurer by virtue of subsection (1A) above, </p><p>the payment is to be regarded as a payment received under that contract by the insurer unless it is chargeable to tax at the higher rate by virtue of section 52A above. </p><p>The new measure applies to all such payments received after 22 March 2007.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT05100:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_IPT05160:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>Section 72(1) of the Finance Act 1994 defines &#8216;premium&#8217; in relation to a taxable insurance contract as:</p><p>&#8230; any payment received under the contract by the insurer, and in particular includes any payment wholly or partly referable to-</p><p>(a) any risk,</p><p>(b) costs of administration,</p><p>(c) commission,</p><p>(d) any facility for paying in instalments or making deferred payment (whether or not payment for the facility is called interest), or</p><p>(e) tax.</p><p>These terms (a) to (e) will be explained in the following paragraphs.</p><p>The definition of premium is an inclusive one.
