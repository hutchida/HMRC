These activities are regarded as transactions by public authorities that fall within the provisions of Article 13 of the EU Principal VAT Directive and are therefore outside the scope of VAT.</p><sup>1</sup><p>Where such testing and approval activities are transferred to private sector businesses, they do not come within the provisions of Article 13 and the fees charged are consideration for taxable services. In some cases these businesses purchase the relevant certificates of approval from the government department or agency. The charging-on of these costs constitutes part of the consideration for the taxable services by the businesses.</p><sup>2</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>3</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
