The company is not a bank or a dealer in securities. On 1 April 2005, it adopted IAS for the first time, accounting for the securities as a compound financial instrument (financial liability plus equity component). On transition, a loan relationships credit of £500,000 would - but for regulation 12(3) of the Disregard Regulations - fall to be brought into account under FA96/SCH9/PARA19A.</p><sup>18</sup><p>In its accounting period ended 31 March 2006, the company - using an effective interest rate method - debits £150,000 in respect of the financial liability component. None of this debit is a ‘share-related’ amount within FA96/S92A(3), so on the formulation of regulation 12(2) applying at the time, the entire debit is allowable. But had the amendment made by SI 2007/948 been in force, to exclude the ‘implied finance cost’, only (say) £90,000 would have been allowable.</p><sup>19</sup><p>Thus for the accounting period ended 31 March 2007, an adjustment of £60,000 (£150,000 - £90,000) is computed under regulation 4(1B) of the Change of Accounting Practice Regulations. This restricts the credit that is disregarded under regulation 12(3) of the Disregard Regulations. Suppose it is agreed that, save for this restriction, £450,000 of £500,000 transitional credit would be thus disregarded. The £60,000 adjustment made reduces the disregarded amount to £390,000. So the amount which is a ‘prescribed credit’ for the Change of Accounting Practice Regulations is £110,000 (£500,000 - £390,000).
