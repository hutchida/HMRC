It must:</p><sup>2</sup><p>meet the public infrastructure income test;</p><sup>3</sup><p>meet the public infrastructure assets test;</p><sup>4</sup><p>be fully taxed in the UK; and</p><sup>5</sup><p>have made a valid election to this exemption, which is in effect.</p><sup>6</sup><h4>Effect of being a QIC</h4><sup>7</sup><p>If a company is a QIC, certain amounts of interest and other finance costs payable are excluded from its tax-interest expense. In addition, further amounts will be ignored or treated as nil for the purposes of the fixed ratio method and group ratio method.</p><sup>8</sup><h4>Transitional rules</h4><sup>9</sup><p>Transitional rules provide that a company may be a qualifying infrastructure company for accounting periods beginning before 1 April 2018 despite not having met all four conditions. In such cases, adjustments are made on a just and reasonable basis to the amounts that are excluded.</p><sup>10</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>11</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
