These are:</p><sup>1</sup><p>the permanent transfer/disposal of business assets (VAT Act 1994, Schedule 4, paragraph 5(1))</p><sup>2</sup><p>the temporary application of business assets to a non-business use (VAT Act 1994, Schedule 4, paragraph 5(4))</p><sup>3</sup><p>the self-supply of goods or services (Treasury Orders, in the form of SIs, made under VAT Act 1994, Sections 5(5) and 5(6)).</p><sup>4</sup><p>A supply is also deemed to have taken place if assets are retained by a trader after deregistration (VAT Act 1994, Schedule 4, paragraph 8).</p><sup>5</sup><p>A supply also takes place where services are put to a private or other non business use - VAT (Supply of Services) Order 1993 (SI 1993/1507).</p><sup>6</sup><p>The above are deemed to be supplies for VAT purposes to prevent the goods or services being enjoyed tax-free by the final consumer. VAT would have been reclaimed on the purchase of the assets or services or on the costs incurred in acquiring or producing goods subject to a self-supply charge, but no output tax collected without the deeming provisions.</p><sup>7</sup><p>Further guidance on the supplies of goods and services for no consideration is contained in VATSC20000 and VATSC27000.</p><sup>8</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>9</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
