There is often a fine line between single and multiple supplies; the approach set out here is intended to simplify the decision making process by identifying the principles to be applied.</p><sup>2</sup><p>This policy was developed from the case law upon which we are reliant because there is no legislation dealing with the subject. The question of whether a transaction is a single supply or multiple supplies has been the subject of numerous appeals to the Tax Tribunal and this guidance also gives summaries of the more relevant case law.</p><sup>3</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
