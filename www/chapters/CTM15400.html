A company could issue bonus shares, capitalising profits, and then repay them without any distribution arising.</p><sup>9</sup><p>To prevent this, the general rule is modified by CTA10/S1026. This provides that if:</p><sup>10</sup><p>the share capital concerned was not issued in return for new consideration, and</p><sup>11</sup><p>the issue of the share capital concerned was not a qualifying distribution,</p><sup>12</sup><p>then distributions the company later makes in respect of such share capital are not treated as repayments of share capital. These distributions are ‘other distributions out of the assets of the company’, and thus within CTA10/S1000 (1) B. But these distributions will not be within CTA10/S1000 (1) B to the extent they (and previous relevant distributions) exceed the share capital issued other than for new consideration (a bonus issue) and the bonus issue was not treated as a qualifying distribution. (See CTA10/S1027).</p><sup>13</sup><p>Thus the effect of CTA10/S1026 and S1027 is that no amount is treated as a repayment of share capital until the amount of such repayment exceeds the total amount of any earlier bonus issues.</p><sup>14</sup><p>CTA10/S1026 does not operate to the extent that the bonus issue fell to be treated at the time of issue as a qualifying distribution, for example under CTA10/S1022.</p><sup>15</sup><p>CTA10/S1026 (1) and (2) are also limited by CTA10/S1026 (3) - see CTM15410.</p><sup>16</sup><h3>Partial repayment</h3><sup>17</sup><p>Where there is a partial repayment, CTA10/S1026 (2) treats the bonus element as repaid in priority to amounts paid up for new consideration.</p><sup>18</sup><h3>Same share capital, CTA10/S1026 (4)</h3><sup>19</sup><p>For the purposes of CTA10/S1026 (2) and S1027, all shares of the same class are treated as representing the same share capital.
