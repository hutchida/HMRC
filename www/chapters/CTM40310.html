Any question of whether or not a friendly society is registered can be answered by CTIS (Insurance) or by checking the FCA Mutuals Register online (https://mutuals.fsa.gov.uk/).&#160;Registration provides a society with a formal structure for its operations.

Registration of a society within one of these categories is irrelevant for taxation purposes. Some registered friendly societies have a federal structure consisting of a central organisation which has local branches tied to it. These societies generally have the word &#8216;order&#8217; in their titles. The title of the branch will combine the name of the order with the name of the branch. For example, &#8216;Ancient Order of Foresters, Court George Stephenson No 4018&#8217; is a branch of the registered friendly society the &#8216;Ancient Order of Foresters&#8217;. For tax purposes, a branch of a registered friendly society is an unincorporated association in its own right and is entitled to the same tax exemptions as a registered friendly society.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM40310:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Incorporated friendly societies</h3><p>The Friendly Societies Act 1992 created a new corporate structure within which a friendly society can be set up and registered.&#160;The FCA registers incorporated societies.&#160;They are given a specific registration number and are required to include the word &#8216;Limited&#8217; in their names.&#160;CTIS (Insurance) can confirm whether or not a society has been registered as an incorporated society.</p><p>From 1 February 1993, a new society may only be registered as an incorporated society.&#160;An existing registered friendly society can (but does not have to) convert itself to an incorporated society.&#160;Incorporated societies and unincorporated (registered) societies will therefore continue to exist in parallel.</p><p>An incorporated society can undertake much the same activities as a registered friendly society.&#160;Additionally, incorporated friendly societies can set up subsidiary companies, which may engage in a wider range of activities than their parent society.&#160;There are special provisions covering the taxation of profits passed up by a subsidiary to an incorporated friendly society.&#160;These provisions are not covered in this guidance.</p><p>Any society that sets up a subsidiary company or acquires shares in a joint venture company should be referred to CTIS (Insurance).</p><p>The legislation provides for an incorporated society to set up local branches.&#160;These will have less autonomy than the branches of registered societies.&#160;They will be charged to tax as part of the incorporated society, not as separate entities.&#160;Any repayments due to a branch will be channelled through the central body of the incorporated society.</p><p>CTIS (Insurance) can advise further.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM40305:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CTM40315:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>There is no statutory definition of a &#8216;friendly society&#8217; as such.
