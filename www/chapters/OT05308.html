The Basilisk crude, which is a Category 2 oil, is normally sold on CIF basis, priced 0-0-5 around the day that the oil is delivered off the tanker at the discharge port. An NAL delivery would be priced for tax purposes around the delivery day at the discharge port. In other words, the NDD is the day of Completion of Discharge. Given that the normal contract terms are 0-0-5 around discharge day, the agreed Category 2 method would reflect that pricing mechanism. The modified NDD under Regulation 24 allows this method to reflect more closely the actual contract terms for this particular (if hypothetical) crude oil.</p><sup>26</sup><p>Alternatively, suppose that Basilisk crude is sold on CIF terms but priced 0-0-5 around the day that the tanker completes loading its cargo from the FPSO. The NDD can then be taken to be the day that the tanker completes loading its cargo from the FPSO. The Category 2 method would be unchanged from example 1, but would be based upon a different date, again reflecting the way that crude is sold.</p><sup>27</sup><p>Another Category 2 crude from Churchill field, is delivered onshore by pipeline to a dedicated facility, where it is exported by tanker. Unusually, this is normally sold CIF priced around the discharge day at the destination port. Here, the NDD will be the day that the oil is loaded onto the tanker at the dedicated onshore facility.
