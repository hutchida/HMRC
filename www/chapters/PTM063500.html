Regulations 2009 - SI 2009/1171</p><p>The legislation provides for certain types of&#160;benefits rights under a registered pension scheme to be commuted and paid as a one-off authorised lump sum if the payment meets all the legislative conditions required to qualify as a trivial commutation lump sum (the guidance on this page explains what those conditions are).</p><p>There is further guidance

See later below for explanations of what pension rights are valued for the purposes of this limit.</p><p>Where the value of these combined pension rights does not exceed the commutation limit on the nominated date, then any of those rights that are either in respect of a defined benefits arrangement or are &#8216;in-payment money-purchase in-house scheme pensions&#8217; may be paid out as trivial commutation lump sums in a specified 12-month commutation period. This period is set by reference to the first trivial commutation lump sum payment by any scheme for that member. That first payment must be made within three months of the nominated date. (See below for more details).</p><p>An individual can have only one 12-month commutation period in their lifetime. So if the member has rights in multiple registered pension schemes, but does not commute them all within the commutation period, those rights will not be able to be commuted later under this rule.</p><p>All the defined benefit rights (including any in payment) under the scheme and any &#8216;in-payment money-purchase in-house scheme pension&#8217; the member has under a registered pension scheme&#160;must be commuted if a trivial commutation lump sum is to be paid from that scheme. However, if the individual holds such rights under more than one scheme, they are not required to commute those benefits under every scheme. They can commute their defined benefits held under one scheme, but not those under another.</p><h3>Commutation limit</h3><p>Paragraph 7(4) Schedule 29 Finance Act 2004</p><p>The commutation limit is &#163;30,000.</p><h3>Lifetime allowance</h3><p>Paragraphs 7(1)(c) and 12(2) Schedule 29 Finance Act 2004</p><p>Paragraph 15 Schedule 32 Finance Act 2004</p><p>The payment of a trivial commutation lump sum is not a BCE so it does not trigger a lifetime allowance test.

This is &#163;16,000 in total.</p><p>If Catherine wants to take these or other benefits as a trivial commutation lump sum, the value taken into account for these crystallised benefits is a total of &#163;16,000.</p><p>Paragraph 8 Schedule 29 and paragraph 10 Schedule 36 Finance Act 2004</p><p>A pension that was in payment on 5 April 2006 is valued by reference to the level of that pension being paid on that date (not at any later BCE or on the nominated date).</p><p>So the crystallised value is calculated in the same way as explained in <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM088300:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM088300</remotelink>, usually by multiplying the annual rate of the pension in payment as at 5 April 2006 by a conversion factor of 25.</p><p>There is no need to consider any tax-free lump sums paid before 6 April 2006. This is because of the higher conversion factor of 25 (which is set at that level on the assumption that a tax-free lump sum would have been drawn at the time the pension came into payment).</p><h3>Example - pension and lump sum came into payment before 6 April 2006</h3><p>On 1 January 2015 Catherine is in receipt of an annual pension of &#163;2,000 per annum. She started receiving this pension in 2001.</p><p>This pension is being valued in relation to a nominated date of 1 June 2015.</p><p>The above pension is considered for commutation limit purposes on the basis of its annual rate as at 5 April 2006. At this date the pension was being paid at the rate of &#163;1,500 per annum.</p><p>So the crystallised value at that date is &#163;37,500 (&#163;1,500 x 25). This is the value to take into account for these crystallised benefits when considering whether Catherine is within the trivial commutation limit. As this value is more than the &#163;30,000 commutation limit, no further lump sum can be paid as a trivial commutation lump sum.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM063500:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Valuing uncrystallised rights</h3><p>For payments made in the past, please read the <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM063500:MANUAL-PARA_SCOPE:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Scope</remotelink> section at the top of this page.</p><p>Section 212 and paragraph 9 Schedule 29 Finance Act 2004</p><p>Any rights the individual holds under any registered pension schemes that have not crystallised for lifetime allowance purposes, that is, where no right to a benefit in payment has arisen yet, must be included in the pension rights valuation for trivial commutation purposes.

She has uncrystallised defined benefits held under three registered pension schemes (scheme A, B and C). Her benefits under each scheme are held in three different arrangements, i.e. A1, A2, A3 etc. Catherine has no other benefits and is not in receipt of any pension in payment. She also has 100% of her lifetime allowance available.</p><p>The rules of all three pension schemes allow the commutation of trivial pensions. Catherine wants to commute her benefits as soon as possible. The nominated date her pension benefits must be valued on must fall within a 3 month period ending on the date the first trivial commutation lump sum is paid. Catherine chooses 1 March 2015 as her nominated date and the valuation comes to &#163;29,000. Catherine therefore has the option of commuting her benefits, as her total pension rights are less than the commutation limit of &#163;30,000.</p><p>To be a valid valuation, the first trivial commutation lump sum payment must be paid before 1 June 2015 (within 3 months of the valuation). Catherine does not have to take all her benefits as trivial commutation lump sums from each scheme. She may choose to take her benefits under one or two of the schemes and not the other(s). But it must be an all or nothing decision in relation to each scheme, i.e. all the arrangements in a scheme must be paid as a trivial commutation lump sum, or none of them.</p><p>Catherine decides to draw all her benefits under schemes A and B as trivial commutation lump sums, i.e. all her rights under arrangements A1, A2 and A3 and B1, B2 and B3. The benefits under scheme A are paid out as a trivial commutation lump sum on 2 May 2015. Her commutation period starts from that date and runs to 1 May 2016. Any payment from scheme B must therefore be paid by that later date, and that payment must represent all her rights under arrangements B1, B2 and B3.</p><p>The benefits under scheme B are paid on 5 June 2015 (within the commutation period).</p><p>Catherine decides to leave the benefits held under scheme C. She can change her mind and decide to fully commute these benefits up until 1 May 2016. But after this date the chance to commute those benefits as a trivial commutation lump sum is lost.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM063500:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Contributions or accrual after the nominated date</h3><p>For payments made in the past, please read the <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM063500:MANUAL-PARA_SCOPE:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Scope</remotelink> section at the top of this page.</p><p>Any contributions made by or on behalf of the member after the nominated date may not be commuted and paid as a trivial commutation lump sum.

This period is set by reference to the first trivial commutation lump sum payment by any scheme for that member. That first payment must be made within three months of the nominated date. (See below for more details).</p><p>An individual can have only one 12-month commutation period in their lifetime.

She has uncrystallised defined benefits held under three registered pension schemes (scheme A, B and C). Her benefits under each scheme are held in three different arrangements, i.e. A1, A2, A3 etc. Catherine has no other benefits and is not in receipt of any pension in payment. She also has 100% of her lifetime allowance available.</p><p>The rules of all three pension schemes allow the commutation of trivial pensions. Catherine wants to commute her benefits as soon as possible. The nominated date her pension benefits must be valued on must fall within a 3 month period ending on the date the first trivial commutation lump sum is paid. Catherine chooses 1 March 2015 as her nominated date and the valuation comes to &#163;29,000. Catherine therefore has the option of commuting her benefits, as her total pension rights are less than the commutation limit of &#163;30,000.</p><p>To be a valid valuation, the first trivial commutation lump sum payment must be paid before 1 June 2015 (within 3 months of the valuation). Catherine does not have to take all her benefits as trivial commutation lump sums from each scheme. She may choose to take her benefits under one or two of the schemes and not the other(s). But it must be an all or nothing decision in relation to each scheme, i.e. all the arrangements in a scheme must be paid as a trivial commutation lump sum, or none of them.</p><p>Catherine decides to draw all her benefits under schemes A and B as trivial commutation lump sums, i.e. all her rights under arrangements A1, A2 and A3 and B1, B2 and B3. The benefits under scheme A are paid out as a trivial commutation lump sum on 2 May 2015. Her commutation period starts from that date and runs to 1 May 2016. Any payment from scheme B must therefore be paid by that later date, and that payment must represent all her rights under arrangements B1, B2 and B3.</p><p>The benefits under scheme B are paid on 5 June 2015 (within the commutation period).</p><p>Catherine decides to leave the benefits held under scheme C. She can change her mind and decide to fully commute these benefits up until 1 May 2016. But after this date the chance to commute those benefits as a trivial commutation lump sum is lost.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM063500:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Contributions or accrual after the nominated date</h3><p>For payments made in the past, please read the <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM063500:MANUAL-PARA_SCOPE:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Scope</remotelink> section at the top of this page.</p><p>Any contributions made by or on behalf of the member after the nominated date may not be commuted and paid as a trivial commutation lump sum.
