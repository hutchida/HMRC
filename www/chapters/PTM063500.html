This period is set by reference to the first trivial commutation lump sum payment by any scheme for that member. That first payment must be made within three months of the nominated date. (See below for more details).</p><sup>28</sup><p>An individual can have only one 12-month commutation period in their lifetime.

However, if the individual holds such rights under more than one scheme, they are not required to commute those benefits under every scheme.

The amount of lump sum actually paid may not necessarily be the same as the value attributed to those benefits as valued on the nominated date on the prescribed basis. What matters is that the benefits were valued on the prescribed basis for commutation limit purposes, did not in aggregate with rights beyond the scheme exceed the commutation limit on the nominated date (see below) and the payment otherwise satisfies the conditions for a trivial commutation lump sum.</p><sup>53</sup><h3>The nominated date for valuing pension rights and the commutation period</h3><sup>54</sup><p>For payments made in the past, please read the</p><sup>55</sup><p>Paragraph 7(2) and (3) Schedule 29 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>56</sup><p>A registered pension scheme may pay a member a trivial commutation lump sum only if their pension rights are valued at no more than the commutation limit on the nominated date. The member must have the opportunity to nominate the date when their pension rights are valued for triviality purposes. The nominated date must fall either on the first day of the commutation period, or within the 3-month period ending on that first day. The member can therefore plan when the 12-month period will run from, and this will dictate the period the nominated date must fall within. However, the nominated date cannot be earlier than 3 months before the first trivial commutation lump sum is paid to the member by any registered pension scheme.</p><sup>57</sup><p>A trivial commutation lump sum can only be paid on or after the member’s 55th birthday unless they are able to take benefits as authorised payments before that age because they either meet the ill-health condition (see</p><sup>58</sup><p>If the member fails to select the nominated date, by default the first day of the commutation period will be the nominated date.</p><sup>59</sup><p>Examples about commuting trivial benefits can be found later below.</p><sup>60</sup><h3>12-month window</h3><sup>61</sup><p>Paragraph 7(1)(a) Schedule 29 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>62</sup><p>The individual has a one-off 12-month period to commute trivial funds across all their schemes.</p><sup>63</sup><p>Any commuted lump sum paid after the 12-month period has ended will not qualify as a trivial commutation lump sum.</p><sup>64</sup><p>The individual may choose to commute trivial benefits in any 12-month period beginning on or after their 55th birthday unless they are able to take benefits as authorised payments before that age because they either meet the ill-health condition (see</p><sup>65</sup><p>The commutation period starts on the day the first commutation payment is made.</p><sup>66</sup><p>For payments made in the past, please read the</p><sup>67</sup><h3>Conditions that must be met for a payment to be a trivial commutation lump sum</h3><sup>68</sup><p>For payments made in the past, please read the</p><sup>69</sup><p>Paragraph 7(1)(a) to (e) Schedule 29 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>70</sup><p>The six conditions that a lump sum payment must meet to be a trivial commutation lump sum for payments made on or after 16 September 2016 are as follows:</p><sup>71</sup><p>the member has not been paid a trivial commutation lump sum previously (from any registered pension scheme), except any earlier payment within the commutation period,</p><sup>72</sup><p>the lump sum is paid in respect of a defined benefits arrangement or an in-payment money-purchase in-house scheme pension, or both,</p><sup>73</sup><p>on the nominated date, the value of the member’s pension rights do not exceed the commutation limit of £30,000,</p><sup>74</sup><p>the lump sum is paid when the member has available lifetime allowance,</p><sup>75</sup><p>the lump sum extinguishes the member’s entitlement to defined benefits and in-payment money-purchase in-house scheme pensions under the registered pension scheme making the payment, and</p><sup>76</sup><p>the lump sum is paid when the member has reached the age of 55 or meets the ill-health condition (see</p><sup>77</sup><p>The reference to extinguishing the member’s entitlement to benefits under the scheme is to all the rights that could reasonably have been known about at the time of the payment. The lump sum will not cease to be an authorised payment purely because further entitlement is later created that could not have been known about at the time of the initial payment, for example, through a pay revision.</p><sup>78</sup><p>Where specifically identifiable contingent beneficiary’s benefits/rights exist under the scheme in relation to the member’s rights that are commutable above, these must be extinguished along with the member’s own entitlement to such benefits.</p><sup>79</sup><h3>Relevant crystallised pension rights</h3><sup>80</sup><p>For payments made in the past, please read the</p><sup>81</sup><p>Paragraph 8 Schedule 29 and paragraph 10 Schedule 36 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>82</sup><p>Regulations 13 and 14, The Registered Pension Schemes (Provision of Information) Regulations 2006 - SI 2006/567</p><sup>83</sup><h3>Valuing pension rights for trivial commutation purposes: relevant crystallised pension rights</h3><sup>84</sup><p>For trivial commutation purposes any benefits that have previously been drawn or crystallised by the individual (or have been deemed to crystallise for lifetime allowance purposes) under any registered pension scheme or previously tax approved pension scheme, whether before, on or after 6 April 2006, must be valued, along with any uncrystallised pension rights of the individual.</p><sup>85</sup><p>A member’s relevant crystallised pension rights are made up of two elements:</p><sup>86</sup><p>the amounts that have crystallised previously for lifetime allowance purposes in respect of the individual (that is, all the BCEs that have occurred for the individual on or since 6 April 2006) - see</p><sup>87</sup><p>the crystallised value of any pensions that were in payment to that individual on 5 April 2006 (relevant existing pensions) - the level in payment on that date is multiplied by 25 (the factor described in</p><sup>88</sup><p>How these two elements of an individual’s relevant crystallised pension rights are valued is explained next.</p><sup>89</sup><h3>Valuing relevant crystallised pension rights: the crystallisation of benefits on or after 6 April 2006</h3><sup>90</sup><p>After a BCE occurs, the scheme administrator will provide the member with a statement confirming the amount that individual has crystallised for lifetime allowance purposes under that scheme, both at that event and any earlier events. The statement will confirm the total percentage of the standard lifetime allowance that has been crystallised in respect of the individual under the scheme. This certificate will be sent either once every tax year up to and including the tax year in which the member reaches age 75 or, where no pension is in payment under the scheme, within 3 months of the BCE.</p><sup>91</sup><p>This percentage value is applied to the level of standard lifetime allowance that applies for the tax year in which the original BCEs fell, to obtain the value of an individual’s crystallised pension rights under that scheme on that date.</p><sup>92</sup><h3>Example - pension and lump sum came into payment on or after 6 April 2006</h3><sup>93</sup><p>In the 2007-08 tax year Catherine started drawing a scheme pension of £700 per annum and was paid a pension commencement lump sum of £2,000 in relation to that pension.</p><sup>94</sup><p>The amount that crystallises at the two BCEs that occurred in 2007-08 is £14,000 through BCE 2 in respect of the arising scheme pension entitlement (20 x £700) and £2,000 through BCE 6 in respect of the lump sum paid. This is £16,000 in total.</p><sup>95</sup><p>If Catherine wants to take these or other benefits as a trivial commutation lump sum, the value taken into account for these crystallised benefits is a total of £16,000.</p><sup>96</sup><p>Paragraph 8 Schedule 29 and paragraph 10 Schedule 36 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>97</sup><p>A pension that was in payment on 5 April 2006 is valued by reference to the level of that pension being paid on that date (not at any later BCE or on the nominated date).</p><sup>98</sup><p>So the crystallised value is calculated in the same way as explained in</p><sup>99</sup><p>There is no need to consider any tax-free lump sums paid before 6 April 2006. This is because of the higher conversion factor of 25 (which is set at that level on the assumption that a tax-free lump sum would have been drawn at the time the pension came into payment).</p><sup>100</sup><h3>Example - pension and lump sum came into payment before 6 April 2006</h3><sup>101</sup><p>On 1 January 2015 Catherine is in receipt of an annual pension of £2,000 per annum. She started receiving this pension in 2001.</p><sup>102</sup><p>This pension is being valued in relation to a nominated date of 1 June 2015.</p><sup>103</sup><p>The above pension is considered for commutation limit purposes on the basis of its annual rate as at 5 April 2006. At this date the pension was being paid at the rate of £1,500 per annum.</p><sup>104</sup><p>So the crystallised value at that date is £37,500 (£1,500 x 25). This is the value to take into account for these crystallised benefits when considering whether Catherine is within the trivial commutation limit. As this value is more than the £30,000 commutation limit, no further lump sum can be paid as a trivial commutation lump sum.</p><sup>105</sup><h3>Valuing uncrystallised rights</h3><sup>106</sup><p>For payments made in the past, please read the</p><sup>107</sup><p>Section 212 and paragraph 9 Schedule 29 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>108</sup><p>Any rights the individual holds under any registered pension schemes that have not crystallised for lifetime allowance purposes, that is, where no right to a benefit in payment has arisen yet, must be included in the pension rights valuation for trivial commutation purposes. This will include any uncrystallised rights that the member wishes to commute.</p><sup>109</sup><p>As these benefits have not crystallised for lifetime allowance purposes, a capital value will not have been attributed to these uncrystallised rights. The way to value these uncrystallised rights depends on whether those rights are held in a cash balance arrangement, money purchase arrangement, defined benefits arrangement or a hybrid arrangement.</p><sup>110</sup><p>For the avoidance of doubt, there is no distinction for the above purposes between rights that have accrued direct in an arrangement, and those that have been transferred in. The term uncrystallised rights includes all the member’s uncrystallised rights under the arrangement.</p><sup>111</sup><h3>Process the scheme administrator must go through</h3><sup>112</sup><p>For payments made in the past, please read the</p><sup>113</sup><p>Sections 239 and 268 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>114</sup><p>A registered pension scheme must take reasonable steps to ensure that any payment they make is authorised, within the meaning of Chapter 5, Finance Act 2004.</p><sup>115</sup><p>If they fail to take such steps, and it transpires that a payment made is an unauthorised member payment, the scheme will become liable to pay a scheme sanction charge (unless the payment falls within narrowly defined circumstances).</p><sup>116</sup><p>Where the authorisation of a payment is conditional on matters which are known only by the member, schemes will need to ask the member to supply sufficient information so that the scheme is satisfied that those conditions are met. For example, they will want to be satisfied that all that member’s pension rights are within the commutation limit on the nominated date.</p><sup>117</sup><p>If the member has pension benefits with other schemes, the commuting scheme will have to ask the member about the value of those benefits, so that it can confirm that the total value of the member’s pension rights falls within the commutation limit.</p><sup>118</sup><p>Where a member gives a scheme inaccurate information or makes a false statement, so that a payment which a scheme considered to be authorised turns out not to be, the scheme can seek discharge from any resulting scheme sanction charge through the ‘good faith’ provisions in the legislation - see</p><sup>119</sup><p>In order to show that a scheme had reasonable grounds for believing that an unauthorised payment was authorised schemes should retain documentary evidence of any member statement or information they have relied on.</p><sup>120</sup><p>Where schemes discover that a payment that they had believed to be authorised is not in fact so, they should report the unauthorised payment on the Event Report - see</p><sup>121</sup><h3>Example</h3><sup>122</sup><p>For payments made in the past, please read the</p><sup>123</sup><p>Catherine is aged 61. She has uncrystallised defined benefits held under three registered pension schemes (scheme A, B and C). Her benefits under each scheme are held in three different arrangements, i.e. A1, A2, A3 etc. Catherine has no other benefits and is not in receipt of any pension in payment. She also has 100% of her lifetime allowance available.</p><sup>124</sup><p>The rules of all three pension schemes allow the commutation of trivial pensions. Catherine wants to commute her benefits as soon as possible. The nominated date her pension benefits must be valued on must fall within a 3 month period ending on the date the first trivial commutation lump sum is paid. Catherine chooses 1 March 2015 as her nominated date and the valuation comes to £29,000. Catherine therefore has the option of commuting her benefits, as her total pension rights are less than the commutation limit of £30,000.</p><sup>125</sup><p>To be a valid valuation, the first trivial commutation lump sum payment must be paid before 1 June 2015 (within 3 months of the valuation). Catherine does not have to take all her benefits as trivial commutation lump sums from each scheme. She may choose to take her benefits under one or two of the schemes and not the other(s). But it must be an all or nothing decision in relation to each scheme, i.e. all the arrangements in a scheme must be paid as a trivial commutation lump sum, or none of them.</p><sup>126</sup><p>Catherine decides to draw all her benefits under schemes A and B as trivial commutation lump sums, i.e. all her rights under arrangements A1, A2 and A3 and B1, B2 and B3. The benefits under scheme A are paid out as a trivial commutation lump sum on 2 May 2015. Her commutation period starts from that date and runs to 1 May 2016. Any payment from scheme B must therefore be paid by that later date, and that payment must represent all her rights under arrangements B1, B2 and B3.</p><sup>127</sup><p>The benefits under scheme B are paid on 5 June 2015 (within the commutation period).</p><sup>128</sup><p>Catherine decides to leave the benefits held under scheme C. She can change her mind and decide to fully commute these benefits up until 1 May 2016. But after this date the chance to commute those benefits as a trivial commutation lump sum is lost.</p><sup>129</sup><h3>Contributions or accrual after the nominated date</h3><sup>130</sup><p>For payments made in the past, please read the</p><sup>131</sup><p>Any contributions made by or on behalf of the member after the nominated date may not be commuted and paid as a trivial commutation lump sum. This similarly applies to any new rights that have accrued after this date. This is because those contributions or rights represent new pension rights that were not in existence on that nominated date and were not included within the pension rights valuation.</p><sup>132</sup><p>Any increase in the value of any commutable rights (that is, defined benefits or in-payment money-purchase in-house scheme pensions) held on the nominated date may however be included in the payment of the trivial commutation lump sum.</p><sup>133</sup><h3>Taxation</h3><sup>134</sup><p>Paragraph 11 Schedule 31 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>135</sup><p>Section 636B Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003</p><sup>136</sup><p>Paragraph 59 Schedule 10 Finance Act 2005</p><sup>137</sup><p>If the member has not previously drawn or become entitled to any other benefits under the registered pension scheme before the trivial commutation lump sum is paid, 75% of the lump sum paid is treated as taxable pension income of the member for the tax year the payment is made, accountable through PAYE.</p><sup>138</sup><p>The 25% deduction is given to reflect that, if the trivial commutation lump sum was not paid and normal benefit rules applied, the member would (generally) be entitled to a tax-free pension commencement lump sum, representing 25% of the capital value of the benefits coming into payment. No extra deduction is given where the member is entitled to a pension commencement lump sum of more than 25% due to the transitional protection of such an entitlement held before 6 April 2006.</p><sup>139</sup><p>Where a pension in payment is being commuted, or the member has previously drawn (or become entitled to) any other benefit from the scheme, but still has uncrystallised rights held in any arrangement under the scheme, 25% of the value of the uncrystallised rights may be paid tax-free. The remaining part of the payment is taxed as pension income for the tax year the lump sum payment is made. Again, this taxable income is accountable through PAYE.</p><sup>140</sup><h3>Operating PAYE on the payment</h3><sup>141</sup><p>Where the lump sum payment is in respect of a pension already in payment, use the PAYE code already in operation.</p><sup>142</sup><p>Where the pension being commuted was not already in payment, use the basic rate (BR) tax code.</p><sup>143</sup><p>Where the recipient is not UK tax resident then use the emergency tax code.</p><sup>144</sup><p>Guidance on how to operate PAYE correctly on these lump sums can be found in CWG2 - Employer’s further guide to PAYE and NICs.

The valuation of the pension rights includes the individual’s benefit entitlements, past and present, including all amounts crystallised previously for lifetime allowance purposes in respect of that individual under all registered pension schemes.

The amount of lump sum actually paid may not necessarily be the same as the value attributed to those benefits as valued on the nominated date on the prescribed basis. What matters is that the benefits were valued on the prescribed basis for commutation limit purposes, did not in aggregate with rights beyond the scheme exceed the commutation limit on the nominated date (see below) and the payment otherwise satisfies the conditions for a trivial commutation lump sum.</p><sup>53</sup><h3>The nominated date for valuing pension rights and the commutation period</h3><sup>54</sup><p>For payments made in the past, please read the</p><sup>55</sup><p>Paragraph 7(2) and (3) Schedule 29 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>56</sup><p>A registered pension scheme may pay a member a trivial commutation lump sum only if their pension rights are valued at no more than the commutation limit on the nominated date. The member must have the opportunity to nominate the date when their pension rights are valued for triviality purposes. The nominated date must fall either on the first day of the commutation period, or within the 3-month period ending on that first day. The member can therefore plan when the 12-month period will run from, and this will dictate the period the nominated date must fall within. However, the nominated date cannot be earlier than 3 months before the first trivial commutation lump sum is paid to the member by any registered pension scheme.</p><sup>57</sup><p>A trivial commutation lump sum can only be paid on or after the member’s 55th birthday unless they are able to take benefits as authorised payments before that age because they either meet the ill-health condition (see</p><sup>58</sup><p>If the member fails to select the nominated date, by default the first day of the commutation period will be the nominated date.</p><sup>59</sup><p>Examples about commuting trivial benefits can be found later below.</p><sup>60</sup><h3>12-month window</h3><sup>61</sup><p>Paragraph 7(1)(a) Schedule 29 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>62</sup><p>The individual has a one-off 12-month period to commute trivial funds across all their schemes.</p><sup>63</sup><p>Any commuted lump sum paid after the 12-month period has ended will not qualify as a trivial commutation lump sum.</p><sup>64</sup><p>The individual may choose to commute trivial benefits in any 12-month period beginning on or after their 55th birthday unless they are able to take benefits as authorised payments before that age because they either meet the ill-health condition (see</p><sup>65</sup><p>The commutation period starts on the day the first commutation payment is made.</p><sup>66</sup><p>For payments made in the past, please read the</p><sup>67</sup><h3>Conditions that must be met for a payment to be a trivial commutation lump sum</h3><sup>68</sup><p>For payments made in the past, please read the</p><sup>69</sup><p>Paragraph 7(1)(a) to (e) Schedule 29 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>70</sup><p>The six conditions that a lump sum payment must meet to be a trivial commutation lump sum for payments made on or after 16 September 2016 are as follows:</p><sup>71</sup><p>the member has not been paid a trivial commutation lump sum previously (from any registered pension scheme), except any earlier payment within the commutation period,</p><sup>72</sup><p>the lump sum is paid in respect of a defined benefits arrangement or an in-payment money-purchase in-house scheme pension, or both,</p><sup>73</sup><p>on the nominated date, the value of the member’s pension rights do not exceed the commutation limit of £30,000,</p><sup>74</sup><p>the lump sum is paid when the member has available lifetime allowance,</p><sup>75</sup><p>the lump sum extinguishes the member’s entitlement to defined benefits and in-payment money-purchase in-house scheme pensions under the registered pension scheme making the payment, and</p><sup>76</sup><p>the lump sum is paid when the member has reached the age of 55 or meets the ill-health condition (see</p><sup>77</sup><p>The reference to extinguishing the member’s entitlement to benefits under the scheme is to all the rights that could reasonably have been known about at the time of the payment. The lump sum will not cease to be an authorised payment purely because further entitlement is later created that could not have been known about at the time of the initial payment, for example, through a pay revision.</p><sup>78</sup><p>Where specifically identifiable contingent beneficiary’s benefits/rights exist under the scheme in relation to the member’s rights that are commutable above, these must be extinguished along with the member’s own entitlement to such benefits.</p><sup>79</sup><h3>Relevant crystallised pension rights</h3><sup>80</sup><p>For payments made in the past, please read the</p><sup>81</sup><p>Paragraph 8 Schedule 29 and paragraph 10 Schedule 36 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>82</sup><p>Regulations 13 and 14, The Registered Pension Schemes (Provision of Information) Regulations 2006 - SI 2006/567</p><sup>83</sup><h3>Valuing pension rights for trivial commutation purposes: relevant crystallised pension rights</h3><sup>84</sup><p>For trivial commutation purposes any benefits that have previously been drawn or crystallised by the individual (or have been deemed to crystallise for lifetime allowance purposes) under any registered pension scheme or previously tax approved pension scheme, whether before, on or after 6 April 2006, must be valued, along with any uncrystallised pension rights of the individual.</p><sup>85</sup><p>A member’s relevant crystallised pension rights are made up of two elements:</p><sup>86</sup><p>the amounts that have crystallised previously for lifetime allowance purposes in respect of the individual (that is, all the BCEs that have occurred for the individual on or since 6 April 2006) - see</p><sup>87</sup><p>the crystallised value of any pensions that were in payment to that individual on 5 April 2006 (relevant existing pensions) - the level in payment on that date is multiplied by 25 (the factor described in</p><sup>88</sup><p>How these two elements of an individual’s relevant crystallised pension rights are valued is explained next.</p><sup>89</sup><h3>Valuing relevant crystallised pension rights: the crystallisation of benefits on or after 6 April 2006</h3><sup>90</sup><p>After a BCE occurs, the scheme administrator will provide the member with a statement confirming the amount that individual has crystallised for lifetime allowance purposes under that scheme, both at that event and any earlier events. The statement will confirm the total percentage of the standard lifetime allowance that has been crystallised in respect of the individual under the scheme. This certificate will be sent either once every tax year up to and including the tax year in which the member reaches age 75 or, where no pension is in payment under the scheme, within 3 months of the BCE.</p><sup>91</sup><p>This percentage value is applied to the level of standard lifetime allowance that applies for the tax year in which the original BCEs fell, to obtain the value of an individual’s crystallised pension rights under that scheme on that date.</p><sup>92</sup><h3>Example - pension and lump sum came into payment on or after 6 April 2006</h3><sup>93</sup><p>In the 2007-08 tax year Catherine started drawing a scheme pension of £700 per annum and was paid a pension commencement lump sum of £2,000 in relation to that pension.</p><sup>94</sup><p>The amount that crystallises at the two BCEs that occurred in 2007-08 is £14,000 through BCE 2 in respect of the arising scheme pension entitlement (20 x £700) and £2,000 through BCE 6 in respect of the lump sum paid. This is £16,000 in total.</p><sup>95</sup><p>If Catherine wants to take these or other benefits as a trivial commutation lump sum, the value taken into account for these crystallised benefits is a total of £16,000.</p><sup>96</sup><p>Paragraph 8 Schedule 29 and paragraph 10 Schedule 36 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>97</sup><p>A pension that was in payment on 5 April 2006 is valued by reference to the level of that pension being paid on that date (not at any later BCE or on the nominated date).</p><sup>98</sup><p>So the crystallised value is calculated in the same way as explained in</p><sup>99</sup><p>There is no need to consider any tax-free lump sums paid before 6 April 2006. This is because of the higher conversion factor of 25 (which is set at that level on the assumption that a tax-free lump sum would have been drawn at the time the pension came into payment).</p><sup>100</sup><h3>Example - pension and lump sum came into payment before 6 April 2006</h3><sup>101</sup><p>On 1 January 2015 Catherine is in receipt of an annual pension of £2,000 per annum. She started receiving this pension in 2001.</p><sup>102</sup><p>This pension is being valued in relation to a nominated date of 1 June 2015.</p><sup>103</sup><p>The above pension is considered for commutation limit purposes on the basis of its annual rate as at 5 April 2006. At this date the pension was being paid at the rate of £1,500 per annum.</p><sup>104</sup><p>So the crystallised value at that date is £37,500 (£1,500 x 25). This is the value to take into account for these crystallised benefits when considering whether Catherine is within the trivial commutation limit. As this value is more than the £30,000 commutation limit, no further lump sum can be paid as a trivial commutation lump sum.</p><sup>105</sup><h3>Valuing uncrystallised rights</h3><sup>106</sup><p>For payments made in the past, please read the</p><sup>107</sup><p>Section 212 and paragraph 9 Schedule 29 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>108</sup><p>Any rights the individual holds under any registered pension schemes that have not crystallised for lifetime allowance purposes, that is, where no right to a benefit in payment has arisen yet, must be included in the pension rights valuation for trivial commutation purposes. This will include any uncrystallised rights that the member wishes to commute.</p><sup>109</sup><p>As these benefits have not crystallised for lifetime allowance purposes, a capital value will not have been attributed to these uncrystallised rights. The way to value these uncrystallised rights depends on whether those rights are held in a cash balance arrangement, money purchase arrangement, defined benefits arrangement or a hybrid arrangement.</p><sup>110</sup><p>For the avoidance of doubt, there is no distinction for the above purposes between rights that have accrued direct in an arrangement, and those that have been transferred in. The term uncrystallised rights includes all the member’s uncrystallised rights under the arrangement.</p><sup>111</sup><h3>Process the scheme administrator must go through</h3><sup>112</sup><p>For payments made in the past, please read the</p><sup>113</sup><p>Sections 239 and 268 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>114</sup><p>A registered pension scheme must take reasonable steps to ensure that any payment they make is authorised, within the meaning of Chapter 5, Finance Act 2004.</p><sup>115</sup><p>If they fail to take such steps, and it transpires that a payment made is an unauthorised member payment, the scheme will become liable to pay a scheme sanction charge (unless the payment falls within narrowly defined circumstances).</p><sup>116</sup><p>Where the authorisation of a payment is conditional on matters which are known only by the member, schemes will need to ask the member to supply sufficient information so that the scheme is satisfied that those conditions are met. For example, they will want to be satisfied that all that member’s pension rights are within the commutation limit on the nominated date.</p><sup>117</sup><p>If the member has pension benefits with other schemes, the commuting scheme will have to ask the member about the value of those benefits, so that it can confirm that the total value of the member’s pension rights falls within the commutation limit.</p><sup>118</sup><p>Where a member gives a scheme inaccurate information or makes a false statement, so that a payment which a scheme considered to be authorised turns out not to be, the scheme can seek discharge from any resulting scheme sanction charge through the ‘good faith’ provisions in the legislation - see</p><sup>119</sup><p>In order to show that a scheme had reasonable grounds for believing that an unauthorised payment was authorised schemes should retain documentary evidence of any member statement or information they have relied on.</p><sup>120</sup><p>Where schemes discover that a payment that they had believed to be authorised is not in fact so, they should report the unauthorised payment on the Event Report - see</p><sup>121</sup><h3>Example</h3><sup>122</sup><p>For payments made in the past, please read the</p><sup>123</sup><p>Catherine is aged 61. She has uncrystallised defined benefits held under three registered pension schemes (scheme A, B and C). Her benefits under each scheme are held in three different arrangements, i.e. A1, A2, A3 etc. Catherine has no other benefits and is not in receipt of any pension in payment. She also has 100% of her lifetime allowance available.</p><sup>124</sup><p>The rules of all three pension schemes allow the commutation of trivial pensions. Catherine wants to commute her benefits as soon as possible. The nominated date her pension benefits must be valued on must fall within a 3 month period ending on the date the first trivial commutation lump sum is paid. Catherine chooses 1 March 2015 as her nominated date and the valuation comes to £29,000. Catherine therefore has the option of commuting her benefits, as her total pension rights are less than the commutation limit of £30,000.</p><sup>125</sup><p>To be a valid valuation, the first trivial commutation lump sum payment must be paid before 1 June 2015 (within 3 months of the valuation). Catherine does not have to take all her benefits as trivial commutation lump sums from each scheme. She may choose to take her benefits under one or two of the schemes and not the other(s). But it must be an all or nothing decision in relation to each scheme, i.e. all the arrangements in a scheme must be paid as a trivial commutation lump sum, or none of them.</p><sup>126</sup><p>Catherine decides to draw all her benefits under schemes A and B as trivial commutation lump sums, i.e. all her rights under arrangements A1, A2 and A3 and B1, B2 and B3. The benefits under scheme A are paid out as a trivial commutation lump sum on 2 May 2015. Her commutation period starts from that date and runs to 1 May 2016. Any payment from scheme B must therefore be paid by that later date, and that payment must represent all her rights under arrangements B1, B2 and B3.</p><sup>127</sup><p>The benefits under scheme B are paid on 5 June 2015 (within the commutation period).</p><sup>128</sup><p>Catherine decides to leave the benefits held under scheme C. She can change her mind and decide to fully commute these benefits up until 1 May 2016. But after this date the chance to commute those benefits as a trivial commutation lump sum is lost.</p><sup>129</sup><h3>Contributions or accrual after the nominated date</h3><sup>130</sup><p>For payments made in the past, please read the</p><sup>131</sup><p>Any contributions made by or on behalf of the member after the nominated date may not be commuted and paid as a trivial commutation lump sum. This similarly applies to any new rights that have accrued after this date. This is because those contributions or rights represent new pension rights that were not in existence on that nominated date and were not included within the pension rights valuation.</p><sup>132</sup><p>Any increase in the value of any commutable rights (that is, defined benefits or in-payment money-purchase in-house scheme pensions) held on the nominated date may however be included in the payment of the trivial commutation lump sum.</p><sup>133</sup><h3>Taxation</h3><sup>134</sup><p>Paragraph 11 Schedule 31 Finance Act 2004</p><sup>135</sup><p>Section 636B Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003</p><sup>136</sup><p>Paragraph 59 Schedule 10 Finance Act 2005</p><sup>137</sup><p>If the member has not previously drawn or become entitled to any other benefits under the registered pension scheme before the trivial commutation lump sum is paid, 75% of the lump sum paid is treated as taxable pension income of the member for the tax year the payment is made, accountable through PAYE.</p><sup>138</sup><p>The 25% deduction is given to reflect that, if the trivial commutation lump sum was not paid and normal benefit rules applied, the member would (generally) be entitled to a tax-free pension commencement lump sum, representing 25% of the capital value of the benefits coming into payment. No extra deduction is given where the member is entitled to a pension commencement lump sum of more than 25% due to the transitional protection of such an entitlement held before 6 April 2006.</p><sup>139</sup><p>Where a pension in payment is being commuted, or the member has previously drawn (or become entitled to) any other benefit from the scheme, but still has uncrystallised rights held in any arrangement under the scheme, 25% of the value of the uncrystallised rights may be paid tax-free. The remaining part of the payment is taxed as pension income for the tax year the lump sum payment is made. Again, this taxable income is accountable through PAYE.</p><sup>140</sup><h3>Operating PAYE on the payment</h3><sup>141</sup><p>Where the lump sum payment is in respect of a pension already in payment, use the PAYE code already in operation.</p><sup>142</sup><p>Where the pension being commuted was not already in payment, use the basic rate (BR) tax code.</p><sup>143</sup><p>Where the recipient is not UK tax resident then use the emergency tax code.</p><sup>144</sup><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Guidance on how to operate PAYE correctly on these lump sums can be found in CWG2 - Employer’s further guide to PAYE and NICs.
