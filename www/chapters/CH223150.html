If you do not have a UK address for a customer which would constitute a valid address for service, you should not issue a Schedule 36 notice or approach the Tribunal to approve one.</p><p>You will need to fully consider all other options available to advance your compliance check.</p><h3>Alternative UK address</h3><p>First of all you should consider whether there is an alternative UK address to which a Schedule 36 notice can be served. The guidance at <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CH23440:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CH23440</remotelink> explains that an information notice can be served:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>at the person&#8217;s usual or last known place of residence, or place of business or employment</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>in the case of a company, at any other prescribed place, or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>in the case of a liquidator of a company, at the liquidator&#8217;s address for the purposes of the liquidation or any other prescribed place.</p></li><p>A notice may also be served on a company by serving it on its &#8216;proper officer&#8217; (see the definition in the Company Taxation Manual CTM00530).</p><h3>Informal request for information</h3><p>You should consider making a further informal request for information. Your request should make it clear to the customer that their assistance and cooperation in providing the information requested will be taken into account when considering any future penalties that may be due.</p><h3>Third Party Information notice</h3><p>Consider whether there are any UK based third parties on which to serve a third party notice, see guidance at <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CH225000:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CH225000</remotelink>. Advising the customer that you intend to seek information from a third party may induce them to provide the information required.</p><h3>Make an assessment</h3><p>Review all information obtained so far and consider whether you have sufficient evidence to justify the making of an assessment. The issue of an assessment is likely to produce an appeal from the customer. If the customer appeals against the assessment then they will be required to provide information to support their appeal.</p><h3>Exchange of Information (EOI)</h3><p>Whilst considering the options listed above you may also wish to consider making an exchange of information (EOI) request to support your check.</p><p>The UK is party to a large number of Double Taxation Agreements and other agreements that provide for the exchange of information, allowing HMRC to obtain information to support your checks. Most countries have similar information powers to the UK that allow them to obtain information from first and third parties.&#160;</p><p>Although there is an expectation to have made full use of domestic powers before considering an EOI request, you are encouraged to contact the EOI teams at an early stage to discuss how they may be able to help you obtain the information required.</p><p>All EOI requests are made by a competent authority &#8211; a specially trained officer appointed to the job by HMRC.
