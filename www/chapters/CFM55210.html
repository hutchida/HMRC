(There is no corresponding provision for debtor loan relationships because chargeable gains arise on disposal of assets - not on liabilities).</p><p>For periods of account beginning before 1 January 2005, FA96/S92 provided that convertible and exchangeable securities meeting the qualifying conditions were not loan relationships for TCGA92 purposes. This had the effect of disapplying TCGA92/S117(A1), with two major consequences. First, a disposal (or part-disposal) of the security gave rise to a chargeable gain or allowable loss. Second, a conversion of the security into shares of the issuer (but not an exchange for shares in some other company) came within the provisions at TCGA92/S132 on conversions of securities (see CG55000+) and was therefore not treated as involving a disposal of the original security.</p><p>A security that carried rights to acquire shares, but failed one of the other conditions for FA96/S92 to apply, remained a normal loan relationship, and therefore a QCB. A conversion of the security into shares fell within TCGA92/S116, and was treated as a disposal of the loan relationship (TCGA92/S116(9)).</p><p>From 1 January 2005, a company holding a convertible or exchangeable security, which has adopted IAS 39 or FRS 26, may account separately for the embedded equity option - the right to acquire shares - and the loan component, or host contract. Details of the accounting are at <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CFM25000:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CFM25000</remotelink> onwards. Where this treatment (sometimes referred to as &#8216;bifurcation&#8217;) is adopted, CTA09/S415 allows the host contract to be taxed as a separate loan relationship (<remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CFM37600:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CFM37600</remotelink>+), while CTA09/S585 brings the embedded option into the derivative contracts regime (<remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CFM50420:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CFM50420</remotelink>).</p><p>But it is important to remember that &#8216;host contract&#8217; and &#8216;embedded derivative&#8217; are accounting fictions, not real assets. TCGA92, which is concerned with disposals of real assets, does not recognise such concepts: instead, it deals with the convertible security as a whole. This raises the possibility of double-counting of gains or losses. The provisions of Chapters 7 and 8 of CTA09/Part 7, in so far as they apply to the holders of convertible or exchangeable securities, therefore do three main things:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>they allow profits or losses arising from the embedded equity option to be charged as capital gains or allowable losses, in appropriate cases,</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>they ensure that conversion of a convertible security is not treated as a disposal, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>they prevent profits or losses that have already been taken into account for loan relationships or derivative contracts purposes from being taxed again under TCGA 92.</p></li><p>These provisions do not, however, apply to convertible or exchangeable securities that were held before 1 January 2005, and to which FA96/S92 previously applied.
