Commonly the given amount will be the book value, the value of the assets in the company’s balance sheet. If the market value of the assets transferred is greater than that given amount, the excess will be a distribution under CTM15250, which deals with distributions under CTA10/S1000 (1) B (distribution out of assets in respect of shares) and G (transfers of assets). Exceptionally, a company may satisfy a dividend by the transfer of assets without specifying any amount. In such cases the amount of the dividend is taken as the book value of the assets and similar treatment applies.</p><sup>8</sup><p>CTM15205 gives further guidance on dividends and distributions from the perspective of company law.</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\CTM15200.xml</p><hr/><sup>0</sup><h3>CTA10/S1000 (1) A</h3><sup>1</sup><p>Most dividends paid by a company, including capital dividends, are distributions.</p><sup>2</sup><p>Exceptions include:</p><sup>3</sup><p>stock dividends (see</p><sup>4</sup><p>dividends paid by building societies (see CTM49470),</p><sup>5</sup><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">dividends paid by Industrial and Provident Societies (see</p><sup>6</sup><p>A capital dividend is a dividend paid out of capital profits.
