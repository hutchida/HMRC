Not every inaccuracy will result in a penalty and penalties for deliberate inaccuracies will be higher than those for careless inaccuracies.</p><sup>13</sup><p>Within the deliberate category the law provides for higher penalties in the most serious cases where the person has taken steps to conceal the deliberate inaccuracy.</p><sup>14</sup><h4>FA07/SCH24/PARA1A</h4><sup>15</sup><h4>FA07/SCH24/PARA3</h4><sup>16</sup><p> Next page</p></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><p>\\lngoxfdatp16vb\Fabrication\Build\0Y04\Data\CH81110.xml</p><hr/><sup>title</sup><h3>The Four Types Of Inaccuracy</h3><sup>0</sup><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">You must check the date from which these rules apply for the tax or duty you are dealing with.
