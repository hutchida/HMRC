The precise rules that determine whether or not a notice has been legally served depend on whether or not the notice relates to direct tax, see below.</p><sup>17</sup><h3>Direct tax and information notices for all taxes</h3><sup>18</sup><p>Under S115 TMA 1970, any notice or other document to be served under the Taxes Acts is legally served on, or sent or delivered to, the person by HMRC if it is addressed to that person</p><sup>19</sup><p>at their usual or last known place of residence, or</p><sup>20</sup><p>at their place of business or employment, or</p><sup>21</sup><p>in the case of a company, at any other prescribed place, or</p><sup>22</sup><p>in the case of a liquidator of a company, at the liquidator’s address for the purposes of the liquidation or any other prescribed place.</p><sup>23</sup><p>This means that any notice that is sent or delivered to a person at any of the above addresses is legally served, irrespective of whether they receive it or not, see EM3853.</p><sup>24</sup><p>These rules also apply to all information notices, irrespective of the tax, issued under Schedule 36 FA08, see</p><sup>25</sup><h3>VAT and other notices</h3><sup>26</sup><p>A VAT notice may be legally served under S98 VATA 1994 by sending it by post in a letter addressed to the person or their VAT representative, at the last or usual residence or place of business of that person or representative. In practice, this is the trader’s registered address.</p><sup>27</sup><p>Where there is no tax specific legislation that determines under what circumstances a notice is legally served, the definition in Section 7 Interpretation Act 1978 will apply. This says that where an Act authorises or requires any document to be served by post then, the service is deemed to be effected by properly addressing, pre-paying and posting a letter containing the document and, unless the contrary is proved, to have been effected at the time at which the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post.</p><sup>28</sup><p>The courts assume that second class post takes 4 working days to be delivered and first class post takes 2 working days. Working days do not include Saturdays, Sundays or bank holidays.</p><sup>29</sup><p>This means that any document that is posted to a person is deemed to be effectively served at the time it is delivered if it is correctly addressed to the registered address, unless there is proof that it has not been delivered. The fact that a letter has been returned RLS is not in itself proof that the notice has not been delivered. The only notices that are considered not to be served are any that are returned clearly stating that the letter was not delivered, for example, if the letter box was sealed or the premises or postal address did not exist.</p><sup>30</sup><h3>DMB Tracing Unit</h3><sup>31</sup><p>If a letter has been returned RLS and there are outstanding debts DMB will not be able to pursue these debts until they have confirmed the person’s correct address. You should, however, still serve a notice at the person’s last known address, provided we have met the appropriate legal requirements, irrespective of whether there are outstanding debts or not.
