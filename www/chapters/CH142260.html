But when he made his self-assessment return he had to make a balancing payment of £6,000. He made the two payments of £9,000 by the due dates and, although he could have paid the extra tax earlier that resulted from the over-reduction, he paid the balancing payment on the due date of 31 January 2014.</p><sup>5</sup><p>We calculate late payment interest on the difference between the payment on account that he should have paid and the payment on account that he did pay.</p><sup>6</sup><p>For this purpose, the payment on account that he should have paid is the lesser of</p><sup>7</sup><p>the amount of the payment on account, plus half of the balancing payment, and</p><sup>8</sup><p>the amount of tax which would have been payable as a payment on account if the claim to reduce the payments on account had not been made.</p><sup>9</sup><p>Here,</p><sup>10</sup><p>is £9,000 + (£6,000/2) = £9,000 + £3,000 = £12,000</p><sup>11</sup><p>is (£36,000/2) = £18,000.</p><sup>12</sup><p>The lesser of (a) and (b) is £12,000.</p><sup>13</sup><p>Therefore, late payment interest is calculated as if the amount of each payment on account was £12,000. As Alan only paid £9,000 by the due dates for each of the two payments on account, we would charge late payment interest on the difference between £12,000 and the actual payment of £9,000, which is £3,000. The late payment interest runs from the due date until the balancing payment is paid. Although Alan had until 31 January 2014 to pay the balancing payment, late payment interest is charged from the two due dates for the payments on account.</p><sup>14</sup><h3>Example - payments on account paid late</h3><sup>15</sup><p>Siobhan made a claim to reduce her payments on account for her 2013-14 year from two payments of £25,000 to two payments of £10,000.
