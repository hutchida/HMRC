It should be ascertained that the company is aware of the basis for settlement set out in IR160, and particularly in relation to disclosure and co- operation. This sets out HMRC’s policy on mitigation of penalties. In every case where errors are determined to have been made negligently, the company will be given the opportunity, once all the facts have been established, to enter into a contract with HMRC.

Mitigation of penalties in a negotiated settlement will therefore take account of disclosure, co- operation, and gravity as explained in IR160. Account will also be taken of the level of PRT charged: in general the tax on any error plus the penalty will not exceed 100% of the amount of the error. Where a company wishes to make an offer in settlement, the CRM will put the facts before the Sector Leader with a recommendation as to the appropriate level of settlement. Where the culpable tax on which the penalty is based exceeds £5 million the Sector Leader will forward the recommendation to the LB Culpability Review Panel.

Where an incorrect claim is made, and that claim also appears in a statement required by PRTA80\S1(1)(a), a penalty will be due in respect of each of these acts: HMRC will not normally take proceedings for both penalties.
