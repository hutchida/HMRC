However, this does not apply where an enquiry notice has been served (see CFM98730) and the enquiry has not been closed - per paragraph 58. In practice, these are the circumstances in which it is most likely that HMRC could invoke these information powers. This follows the pattern of FA08/SCH36/PARA21(2) to (8), as regards a company tax return.</p><sup>2</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>3</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
