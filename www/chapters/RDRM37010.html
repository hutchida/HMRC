Can individuals change their domicile status if they do not want to pay the remittance basis charge?</h3><p>The changes to the remittance basis do not affect an individual&#8217;s domicile status, which is a matter of general, not tax law (refer to <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_RDRM20080:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">RDRM20080</remotelink>).</p><p>As a matter of general law, a person who does not have a domicile of origin (or dependency) within the United Kingdom will only become domiciled within the UK if the UK is their permanent home, that is, they intend to remain here indefinitely.</p><p>Individuals cannot, and do not need to, change their domicile status purely to &#8216;avoid&#8217; the remittance basis or the remittance basis charge.

Does everyone who is non-domiciled in the UK have to pay the &#163;30,000 RBC?</h3><p>No. The charge is only payable where someone wants to use the remittance basis and they are 18 years of age and over with more than &#163;2,000 un-remitted foreign income or gains. It is also only payable by remittance basis users who are tax resident in the UK for the year of the claim and have been resident in at least seven of the previous nine tax years.</p><p>Refer to <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_RDRM32210:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">RDRM32210</remotelink>.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_RDRM37010:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>3. If individuals claim to use the remittance basis and pay the &#163;30,000 remittance basis charge, do they also have to pay tax on any foreign income or gains remitted to the UK?</h3><p>Yes, if they make a taxable remittance of any of their foreign income or capital gains that arose or accrued in a year in which they used the remittance basis they will have to pay tax on the amount remitted.</p><p>If they remit income or gains that they have &#8216;nominated&#8217; in order to pay the &#163;30,000 remittance basis charge they will not be due to pay further tax on it.
