For the purpose of this example, the annual increase in CPI to the September before the tax year is 3.2 per cent.</p><p>During the pension input period in question Tundi changes jobs. He joins his new employer&#8217;s career average scheme (which is also a defined benefits arrangement). Tundi earns a pension of 2 per cent of his annual pay rate for the year from this scheme. The scheme does not give a separate lump sum. If Tundi wants to take a lump sum when he retires he must give up (commute) pension to get the lump sum.</p><p>Tundi transfers his benefits from his old final salary scheme (scheme 1) into the new career average scheme (scheme 2).&#160;</p><h3>Calculating the opening values</h3><p>Tundi&#8217;s opening value for scheme 1 (the final salary scheme) is calculated as:</p><p>Find amount of annual pension</p><p>19/80 x &#163;65,000 = &#163;15,437.50 </p><p>Multiply annual rate of pension by flat factor of 16</p><p>&#163;15,437.50 x 16 = &#163;247,000 </p><p>Add amount of separate lump sum</p><p>&#163;247,000 + (19 x 3/80 x &#163;65,000) = &#163;293,312.50 </p><p>Increase by CPI</p><p>&#163;293,312.50 x 1.032 = &#163;302,698.50 </p><p>So the opening value for scheme 1 is &#163;302,698.50.</p><p>The opening value for scheme 2 is nil (as Tundi is a new member at the start of the pension input period for the arrangement under scheme 2).</p><h3>Calculating the closing values</h3><p>The closing values for both scheme 1 and scheme 2 need to be adjusted because of the transfer value. If this was not done the pension input amounts for both schemes would not be correct. This adjustment is only needed for the pension input period that the transfer takes place in.</p><p>Without an adjustment the closing value for scheme 1 would be nil (as all the benefits have been given up in exchange for a transfer out). The amount of Tundi&#8217;s benefit rights in scheme 1 that he exchanged for the transfer payment is added back to the closing value for scheme 1. At the point Tundi arranged the transfer he had built up a pension of &#163;16,800 and a separate lump sum of &#163;50,400 in scheme 1.</p><p>This means that the closing value for scheme 1 is:</p><p>Find amount of annual pension</p><p>&#163;16,800 </p><p>Multiply annual rate of pension by flat factor of 16</p><p>&#163;16,800 x 16 = &#163;268,800 </p><p>Add amount of separate lump sum</p><p>&#163;268,800 + &#163;50,400 = &#163;319,200 </p><p>The closing value for scheme 1 is &#163;319,200.</p><p>In scheme 2 the transfer payment from scheme 1 was able to fund (or &#8216;purchase&#8217;) a pension equivalent of &#163;18,300. In the pension input period for scheme 2 Tundi has earned a pension of &#163;800 from his new job. This makes his total annual pension under the scheme &#163;19,100. Without an adjustment to take account of the transfer in, the closing value for scheme 2 would be &#163;305,600 (&#163;19,100 x 16).</p><p>To find the closing value for scheme 2 the effect of the transfer is neutralised because the pension equivalent of &#163;18,300 was no more than the amount that the transfer payment was capable of purchasing in scheme 2. The closing value for the pension input period is based only on the rights built up under scheme 2 - that is a pension of &#163;800.</p><p>So the closing value for scheme 2 is:</p><p>Find amount of annual pension</p><p>&#163;800 </p><p>Multiply annual rate of pension by flat factor of 16</p><p>&#163;800 x 16 = &#163;12,800 </p><p>Add amount of separate lump sum</p><p>&#163;12,800 + &#163;0 (there is no separate lump sum) = &#163;12,800 </p><p>The closing value for scheme 2 is &#163;12,800.</p><h3>Finding the pension input amounts</h3><p>Tundi&#8217;s pension inputs from his defined benefits arrangements are:</p><p>For scheme 1: closing value (&#163;319,200) - opening value (&#163;302,698.50) = &#163;16,501.50</p><p>For scheme 2: closing value (&#163;12,800) - opening value (nil) = &#163;12,800</p><p>As Tundi is not a member of any other arrangement his total pension input amount for the tax year is &#163;29,301.50 (&#163;16,501.50 + &#163;12,800).</p><p>For future tax years, the pension input amount is calculated as normal, with no adjustment for the transfer.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM053710:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Example of adjustment of closing value for a pension credit</h3><p>Angela is a member of a cash balance arrangement.

She also wants to keep working and keep building up benefits. Julia&#8217;s pension scheme allows her to do this. Julia takes a pension of &#163;12,000 and a lump sum of &#163;80,000. To get her lump sum Julia had to give up &#163;6,000 pension.

This does not reflect the fact that Julia has built up extra pension benefits over the pension input period. An amount equivalent to the BCE needs to be added back into the closing value. The adjustment to the closing value is made at step 1 by adding back the amount of pension taken.

At the point Tundi arranged the transfer he had built up a pension of &#163;16,800 and a separate lump sum of &#163;50,400 in scheme 1.</p><p>This means that the closing value for scheme 1 is:</p><p>Find amount of annual pension</p><p>&#163;16,800 </p><p>Multiply annual rate of pension by flat factor of 16</p><p>&#163;16,800 x 16 = &#163;268,800 </p><p>Add amount of separate lump sum</p><p>&#163;268,800 + &#163;50,400 = &#163;319,200 </p><p>The closing value for scheme 1 is &#163;319,200.</p><p>In scheme 2 the transfer payment from scheme 1 was able to fund (or &#8216;purchase&#8217;) a pension equivalent of &#163;18,300. In the pension input period for scheme 2 Tundi has earned a pension of &#163;800 from his new job. This makes his total annual pension under the scheme &#163;19,100. Without an adjustment to take account of the transfer in, the closing value for scheme 2 would be &#163;305,600 (&#163;19,100 x 16).</p><p>To find the closing value for scheme 2 the effect of the transfer is neutralised because the pension equivalent of &#163;18,300 was no more than the amount that the transfer payment was capable of purchasing in scheme 2. The closing value for the pension input period is based only on the rights built up under scheme 2 - that is a pension of &#163;800.</p><p>So the closing value for scheme 2 is:</p><p>Find amount of annual pension</p><p>&#163;800 </p><p>Multiply annual rate of pension by flat factor of 16</p><p>&#163;800 x 16 = &#163;12,800 </p><p>Add amount of separate lump sum</p><p>&#163;12,800 + &#163;0 (there is no separate lump sum) = &#163;12,800 </p><p>The closing value for scheme 2 is &#163;12,800.</p><h3>Finding the pension input amounts</h3><p>Tundi&#8217;s pension inputs from his defined benefits arrangements are:</p><p>For scheme 1: closing value (&#163;319,200) - opening value (&#163;302,698.50) = &#163;16,501.50</p><p>For scheme 2: closing value (&#163;12,800) - opening value (nil) = &#163;12,800</p><p>As Tundi is not a member of any other arrangement his total pension input amount for the tax year is &#163;29,301.50 (&#163;16,501.50 + &#163;12,800).</p><p>For future tax years, the pension input amount is calculated as normal, with no adjustment for the transfer.</p><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_PTM053710:MANUAL-PARA_TOP:PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="invalid">Top of page</remotelink></p><h3>Example of adjustment of closing value for a pension credit</h3><p>Angela is a member of a cash balance arrangement.

She also wants to keep working and keep building up benefits. Julia&#8217;s pension scheme allows her to do this. Julia takes a pension of &#163;12,000 and a lump sum of &#163;80,000. To get her lump sum Julia had to give up &#163;6,000 pension. So if Julia had not taken a lump sum she would be getting a pension of &#163;18,000.</p><p>At the end of the pension input period&#160;Julia has &#163;10,000 pension still to take.</p><p>For the purpose of this example, the annual increase in&#160;CPI to the September before the tax year&#160;is 3 per cent.</p><h3>Calculating the opening value</h3><p>Julia&#8217;s opening value for the scheme is calculated as:</p><p>Find amount of annual pension</p><p>&#163;26,500 </p><p>Multiply annual rate of pension by flat factor of 16</p><p>&#163;26,500 x 16 = &#163;424,000 </p><p>Add amount of separate lump sum</p><p>There is no separate lump sum = &#163;424,000 </p><p>Increase by CPI</p><p>&#163;424,000 x 1.03 = &#163;436,720 </p><p>Julia&#8217;s opening value is &#163;436,720.</p><h3>Calculating the closing value</h3><p>Without any adjustment for the BCE Julia&#8217;s closing value would be &#163;160,000 (&#163;10,000 x 16). This does not reflect the fact that Julia has built up extra pension benefits over the pension input period. An amount equivalent to the BCE needs to be added back into the closing value. The adjustment to the closing value is made at step 1 by adding back the amount of pension taken.
