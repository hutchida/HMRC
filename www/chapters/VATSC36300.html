However, it is possible that, as part of such a settlement, the suing party will grant the offender a right - for example, permission for future use of a trading title - in return for a payment. In that case, the payment is consideration for a supply for VAT purposes.</p><sup>2</sup><p>This is supported by the Tribunal decision in the case of Cooper Chasney Ltd (LON/89/1409Z).</p><sup>3</sup><p>In this case Cooper Chasney (CC) discovered that another company had been using its trading name and logo and that this was damaging its business. As a result, it began proceedings against the offending party but subsequently settled the matter by agreeing to abandon its rights to the name and logo in return for a payment of Â£30,000 from the offender.</p><sup>4</sup><p>The Tribunal found that this payment was more than damages for unauthorised use of the name/ logo. It was consideration for CC giving up its rights to these items and tax was due.</p><sup>5</sup><p>As a final point, there is no supply for VAT purposes simply because a party agrees to settle out of court.</p><sup>6</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>7</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
