The replacement research funding project from 2014 to 2020 is called Horizon 2020.</p><sup>3</sup><p>Under Horizon 2020, researchers bid for funds for their projects and, once a proposal passes the evaluation stage, the Commission draws up a grant agreement with each participant. The grant agreement confirms what research and innovation activities will be undertaken, the project duration, budget, rates and costs, the European Commission’s contribution etc.</p><sup>4</sup><p>HMRC gave some advice on Frameworks 5, 6 and 7 to the effect that the payments were consideration for a supply with associated input tax recovery. Following clarification from the EU Commission, funds received by researchers under EU Framework Programme 7 were confirmed to be grants and this also applied to the Frameworks 5 &amp; 6. Any VAT incurred in the course of such funded research is not deductible.</p><sup>5</sup><p>Any payment made under the Horizon 2020 programme is similarly treated as grant in aid paid to fund research. It does not constitute consideration for any supplies by the person receiving the funding to the person paying it. In these circumstances, research that is wholly grant funded is not a business activity for VAT purposes and is not within the scope of VAT.</p><sup>6</sup><p>UK research bodies cannot deduct as input tax VAT relating to purchases incurred in the course of research that is wholly funded in this way.</p><sup>7</sup><p>However, where HMRC gave a written ruling that the funding under Frameworks 5, 6 &amp; 7 were taxable, we accept that input tax can be recovered where output tax has been accounted for and we will take no action to correct this. Any funding under Horizon 2020 should be treated correctly from the start as grants which are outside the scope of VAT with no right to recover VAT incurred on related expenditure.</p><sup>8</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>9</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
