No interest is, however, paid on the loan. Thus for years ended 31 December 2007, 2008 and 2009, no interest debits are allowed, in accordance with CTA09/S373.</p><p>The group company which is the creditor is not resident in a tax haven, so following the amendment to CAT09/S373 by FA09, interest could be deducted on an accruals basis. The company, however, elects under FA09/SCH20/PARA9(2) (<remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CFM35970:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">CFM35970</remotelink>) for the &#8216;paid&#8217; basis to continue to apply in its first accounting period beginning on or after 1 April 2009 - which is year ended 31 December 2010. Under the amended legislation, an accruals basis applies for tax purposes in year ended 31 December 2011. The whole of the interest arrears are finally paid in 2012.</p><p>The worldwide group to which the company belongs also prepares accounts to 31 December, so the UK company must apply the debt cap rules in year ended 31 December 2010. Its position in computing its financing expense amounts is as follows:</p><p>Year ended 31 December 2010: no debits relating to interest on the loan are brought into account, so there is no financing expense amount within TIOPA2010/S313(2) in respect of that loan.</p><p>Year ended 31 December 2011: interest is brought into account on an accruals basis, and is a financing expense amount.</p><p>Year ended 31 December 2012: the interest which accrued in 2007, 2008 and 2009, and which is now paid, will be deductible for tax purposes. But, absent the &#8216;late interest&#8217; rule, these amounts would have been deducted in periods beginning before 1 January 2010. The TIOPA2010/SCH9/PARA32 transitional rule means that the resultant debits are not a financing expense amount of the company.</p><p>The interest which accrued in 2010 will also now be deductible. The transitional rule does not apply to these debits, because they did not accrue in a period beginning before 1 January 2010, and accordingly they form part of the financing expense amount for year ended 31 December 2012, along with those debits representing the interest accrued in 2012.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CFM90160:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_CFM90180:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><h3>{#IDA5FHID}This guidance applies to worldwide group periods of account ending before or straddling 1 April 2017.</h3><h3>Commencement and transitional provisions {#}</h3><p>The debt cap legislation has effect for periods of account of the worldwide group that begin on or after 1 January 2010.
