However, there may be cases where credits will arise either in the same period (for example, in an interest-rate swap where LIBOR is swapped for say 0.5% fixed) or in different periods. In this respect derivative transactions differ from loan relationships, so there are special rules at CTA09/S692 to recognise this. The result of these special rules is to ring-fence the unallowable ‘tainted’ debits so that they may be set only against credits from the same contract but not against any other profits.</p><sup>2</sup><p>Under S692 it is the ‘amount of the excess accumulated net losses’ of a contract for an accounting period that is brought into account as a debit for that period.</p><sup>3</sup><p>The ‘amount of the excess accumulated net losses’ is found as follows:</p><sup>4</sup><p>Step 1: Add together the amount of any net loss arising for the accounting period and earlier accounting periods.
