However, there may be cases where credits will arise either in the same period (for example, in an interest-rate swap where LIBOR is swapped for say 0.5% fixed) or in different periods. In this respect derivative transactions differ from loan relationships, so there are special rules at CTA09/S692 to recognise this. The result of these special rules is to ring-fence the unallowable &#8216;tainted&#8217; debits so that they may be set only against credits from the same contract but not against any other profits. </p><p>Under S692 it is the &#8216;amount of the excess accumulated net losses&#8217; of a contract for an accounting period that is brought into account as a debit for that period.</p><p>The &#8216;amount of the excess accumulated net losses&#8217; is found as follows:</p><p>Step 1: Add together the amount of any net loss arising for the accounting period and earlier accounting periods.
