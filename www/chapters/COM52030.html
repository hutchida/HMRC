In particular, Schedule 1A applies to an election that does not relate to a particular AP and a&#160;claim made within the time limit for that claim but after the time limit for amendment of the return.</p><p>An election that does not relate to a particular AP may have effect in relation, for example, to a particular sort of income until it is withdrawn. Such an election is not tied to specific APs, takes effect from a particular date and remains in force until it is revoked. Any such claim or election falls within Schedule 1A in all circumstances.</p><p>Claims and elections to which Schedule 1A applies are to be made outside any return, to an officer of the Board, in such form as the Board may require. They must also contain a declaration that the particulars given are correctly stated &#8216;to the best of the information and belief of the person making the claim&#8217;. In practice, the Board does not normally determine forms for CT claims and the statutory requirement for the claim to contain a declaration is not normally insisted upon.</p><p>Much the same powers and rights of correction, amendment and enquiry apply to these claims as to returns, as do the record-keeping and record preservation obligations and the related penalties and the finality rules. There are, however, important distinctions between the Schedule 1A TMA 1970 and Schedule 18 FA 1998 enquiry regimes and different closure procedures apply to each.</p><p>For more information about Schedule 1A, see the Enquiry Handbook (at EH1080-1082, EH930 onwards - particularly EH949, and EH460 onwards) and the Company Taxation Manual at CTM90635.
