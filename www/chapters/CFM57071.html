A similar rule applies where the hedged item is accounted for on a fair value basis. This will require computational adjustments, although in many cases the treatment will still broadly be to follow the amounts in profit or loss. </p><h3>Designated Cash flow hedge</h3><p>If the company has a designated cash flow hedge, then regulation 9A will have effect. For tax purposes the company will simply follow the amounts recognised in profit or loss. Amounts recognised in OCI will not be brought into account until they are transferred to profit or loss (or in certain cases capitalised in the carrying value of an asset or liability).
