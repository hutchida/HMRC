Profits from the exploitation of oil and gas in the UK and on the UK continental shelf are subject to a special regime known as RFCT (Ring Fence Corporation Tax). Very broadly income from oil extraction activities (s272) or oil rights (s273) is treated as income (s275) from a ring fenced trade (s277) which comprises all oil-related activities (s274).</p><sup>1</sup><p>For CIR purposes the integrity of this ring fence is maintained and the rules exclude ring-fence activities entirely from the interest restriction calculation.</p><sup>2</sup><p>This includes:</p><sup>3</sup><p>Ring fence income (CTA10/S275)</p><sup>4</sup><p>A companyâ€™s aggregate gain or loss (TCGA92/S197(3))</p><sup>5</sup><p>This means that any amounts taken into account in the calculation of the ring fence profits need to be excluded from the amounts of tax-interest and tax-EBITDA for the group in respect of the period of account. As a result, no restriction can be allocated to the ring-fenced business.</p></div></body></html>
