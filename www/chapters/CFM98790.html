The steps that the reporting company is expected to take will normally include submitting one (or more) interest restriction returns.</p><sup>4</sup><p>The closure notice may simply state revised group level numbers, or may also set out how the amounts should be allocated to group members (PARA49(3)).</p><sup>5</sup><p>Closure notices and steps required in more complex scenarios are dealt with at CFM98820 et seq.</p><sup>6</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>7</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
