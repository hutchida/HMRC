These arrangements may include the creation of two or more ‘sub-funds’ within the single fund entity, with each ‘sub-fund’ having a different market investment strategy. Such schemes are commonly called ‘umbrella’ funds.</p><sup>1</sup><p>For example, the ABC unit trust operates an umbrella scheme with three sub-funds. The prospectus and terms of the trust provide for the following:</p><sup>2</sup><p>ABC Income Fund - All cash contributions received from investors will be invested by the fund in purchasing a range of United Kingdom company stocks and shares;</p><sup>3</sup><p>ABC Global Fund - All cash contributions received from investors will be invested by the fund in purchasing a range of non-United Kingdom company stocks and shares;</p><sup>4</sup><p>ABC European Fund - All cash contributions received from investors will be invested by the fund in purchasing a range of European company stocks and shares (which of course may include United Kingdom company stocks and shares).</p><sup>5</sup><p>For stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) charging purposes, each sub-fund of an umbrella scheme is regarded as a unit trust scheme in its own right (FA99/SCH19/PARA18). Each sub-fund of an OEIC is similarly regarded for stamp duty and SDRT purposes as a separate fund entity by virtue of SI 1997/1156 and SI 1999/3261 as it applies to FA99/SCH19/PARA18.</p><sup>6</sup><p>See STSM101010 for the meaning of a Collective Investment Scheme.</p><sup>7</sup><p>See STSM101020 and STSM101030 for the meaning of a Unit Trust.</p><sup>8</sup><p>See STSM101050 for the meaning of an Open-Ended Investment Company.</p><sup>9</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>10</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
