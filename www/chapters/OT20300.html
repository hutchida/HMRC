Although the details of contracts vary, a typical one may specify that the purchaser is required to pay the seller for a certain quantity of gas each year, whether or not the purchaser can take delivery of that quantity in the year. If it cannot take delivery, the purchaser may be allowed credit in future years for any payments in respect of gas not taken. There may be circumstances where payments are refundable.</p><sup>1</sup><p>For accountancy purposes, it is usual for payments by the purchaser for gas not delivered at an accounting date to be dealt with as deferred credits in the balance sheet of the seller. They are regarded as payments in advance for gas to be delivered, and are released to the profit and loss account when the purchaser is entitled to receive credit for them.
