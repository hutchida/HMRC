recognised overseas pension scheme (QROPS) is not the only situation in which the overseas transfer charge can arise.&#160;The tax charge can also arise if there is a change in circumstances within the relevant period from the date of the original transfer.&#160;See <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM102200:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM102200</remotelink> for the meaning of the terms relevant period and original transfer.</p><p>A tax liability arises after a transfer if the reason the charge did not apply at the time of the transfer from the registered pension scheme, QROPS or former QROPS was because, when the transfer occurred:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the member was resident as that in the same country in which the QROPS receiving the transfer is established, or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the member was resident in a country within the European Economic Area (EEA) and the QROPS is also established in a country within the EEA</p></li><p>and after the transfer circumstances change so that none of the conditions for exclusion from the overseas transfer charge are met.</p><p>The overseas transfer charge arises at the time that the member ceases to meet any of the exclusion conditions for the overseas transfer charge.</p><h3>Example</h3><p>Mary is resident in New Zealand and transfers her pension savings under a registered pension scheme to a New Zealand QROPS.&#160;Mary asked her scheme administrator to make the transfer on 5 May 2017 and the transfer was made to the New Zealand scheme on 11 August 2017.&#160;At the time of the transfer it is not subject to the overseas transfer charge as Mary is resident in the same country as that in which the QROPS is established.&#160;The relevant period for this transfer runs until 5 April 2023 (11 August 2017 to 5 April 2018, plus 6 April 2018 to 5 April 2023).&#160;In May 2021 Mary becomes resident in Australia and ceases to be New Zealand resident.&#160;As she is no longer resident in the same country as the QROPS, the overseas transfer charge now arises on her transfer.&#160;</p><h3>Who is liable to pay the overseas transfer charge</h3><p>Section 244J(4) Finance Act 2004</p><p>Where the overseas transfer charge arises due to a change of circumstances after the transfer both the member and the scheme manager of the QROPS (or former QROPS) that currently holds the transferred funds are liable to the tax charge.&#160;Liability is joint and several and arises whether or not any of the people liable to the charge are UK resident or domiciled.</p><p>So, in the example above, it is the scheme manager of the New Zealand QROPS that together with Mary becomes liable to the overseas transfer charge when Mary becomes resident in Australia in May 2021.</p><h3>Requirement to notify change of residence</h3><p>Regulation 11BB Registered Pension Schemes (Provision of Information) Regulations 2006 - SI 2006/567</p><p>Regulation 3AF The Pension Schemes (Information Requirements for Qualifying Overseas Pension Schemes, Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Schemes and Corresponding Relief) Regulations 2006 &#8211; SI 2006/208</p><p>If a transfer was excluded from the overseas transfer charge because the member was resident in:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the same country as that in which the QROPS is established, or</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>a country within the European Economic Area (EEA) and the QROPS is also established in a country within the EEA</p></li><p>the member needs to tell the transferring scheme administrator or manager and the receiving QROPS scheme manager when they become resident or stop being resident in a country.&#160;<remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM102950:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM102950</remotelink> provides more information about this requirement.</p><p>On receipt of this information the scheme manager of the receiving QROPS must work out if the overseas transfer charge now arises.&#160;</p><p>If the receiving QROPS is not established in an EEA country the transfer will become subject to the tax charge if the member is no longer resident in the same country as that in which the scheme is established.&#160;</p><p>If the receiving QROPS is established in a country that is within the EEA the transfer becomes subject to the overseas transfer charge if the member is not resident in a country that is a member of the EEA.</p><h3>The amount of the overseas transfer charge</h3><p>Section 244K(6) Finance Act 2004</p><p>The amount of the overseas transfer charge is 25% of the &#8216;transferred value&#8217;.&#160;Where the overseas transfer charge arises due to a change of circumstance after a transfer, the &#8216;transferred value&#8217; is limited to the amount of the sums and assets under the member&#8217;s ring-fenced transfer funds (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM113230:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM113230</remotelink> for definition) under any QROPS or former QROPS.</p><p><remotelink

transfer charge.</p><h3>Telling HMRC about liability to the overseas transfer charge</h3><p>Regulation 3(2B) and (3A) The Pension Schemes (Information Requirements for Qualifying Overseas Pension Schemes, Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Schemes and Corresponding Relief) Regulations 2006 &#8211; SI 2006/208</p><p>Scheme managers are required to tell HMRC if their scheme received a recognised transfer or onward transfer that was not subject to the overseas transfer charge and due to a change of circumstances the tax charge is now due.</p><p>They must do this within 90 days of being told of the change of residence that results in the overseas transfer charge now being due.&#160;</p><p>The scheme manager must give HMRC the following information:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the fact the overseas transfer charge is now due because of change of residence</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the date that the member changed country of residence</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the &#8216;transferred value&#8217; of the transfer (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM102500:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID"

accounted for, or intend to account for, the tax charge, and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the value of the member&#8217;s relevant transfer fund and ring-fenced transfer fund(s) that remain after the tax charge has become due.</p></li><p>Scheme managers can use form APSS 244 available on Gov.UK to notify HMRC.</p><p>No report is needed if</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the member payment provisions and tax charges no longer apply to the member (see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM113210:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM113210</remotelink>) and</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>it is more than 10 years from the key date of the ring-fenced transfer fund created under the scheme as a result of the transfer.</p></li><p>If the scheme manager does not make the required reports when due HMRC can remove the scheme&#8217;s QROPS status &#8211; see <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_PTM102500:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">PTM112500</remotelink>.</p><h3>Paying the overseas transfer charge</h3><p>When HMRC receives the report they will give the scheme manager an accounting reference and bank details for the scheme manager to use to pay the overseas transfer charge due.</p><p>The due date for payment of the overseas transfer charge is 90 days following the date that HMRC issues the accounting reference details to the scheme manager.</p><p>If the scheme manager does not pay the overseas transfer charge by the due date:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>interest will be charged on the amount outstanding from the due date until the date it is paid</p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>HMRC will issue a notice of assessment to the scheme manager for the charge.
