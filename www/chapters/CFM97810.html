This affects companies which apply International Financial Reporting Standards, including through the adoption of FRS 101. IFRS 16 is mandatory for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019 (with early adoption permitted).</p><sup>11</sup><p>In particular, the new accounting standard is likely to mean that more assets and liabilities will be included in the lessee’s accounts. IFRS 16 does not change the position of the lessor.</p><sup>12</sup><h4>Current tax treatment</h4><sup>13</sup><p>FA11/S53 contains a rule which means that the tax rules are applied on the basis that there has been no change in the accounting standards dealing with leases. As such, any company which currenctly applies IFRS 16 (eg. early adopters) will need to prepare their tax computations on the basis of the old accounting requirements. This will also apply to the application of the corporate interest restriction rules.</p><sup>14</sup><h4>From 1 January 2019</h4><sup>15</sup><p>As a result of the introduction of the new accounting standard for leasing, IFRS 16, HMRC has proposed that certain legislative changes will be made to the corporate interest restriction rules, effective from 1 January 2019.</p><sup>16</sup><p>For further details, please refer to the consultation document:</p><sup>17</sup><p>https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/corporate-interest-restricti…</p><sup>18</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
