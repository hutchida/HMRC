If they are unable to do this, then they must classify the interests as part of their non-exempt investments. Upon any HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) enquiry, a manager may be requested to provide evidence that the interest in the underlying scheme did indeed qualify as an exempt investment by meeting the two conditions outlined above. Historic evidence may be used (although at the time that it is being used it should be as far as practical the most recently available version) as long as there is no indication that it has become unreliable or that circumstances have changed.

However, some regulators restrict what schemes can be called. For example, in the UK an authorised fund must not have a misleading name. Where the name of a scheme, in the context of its local regulatory environment, implies that it meets the requirements of the exemption then this may be used as evidence by a fund manager. However, this should be treated as one piece of evidence which will normally require additional validation unless, given the relevant regulatory environment, it is very clear that the scheme meets the requirements of the exemption.</p><p>For example, HMRC will accept that interests in a collective investment scheme authorised within the EU that has the words &#8220;money market fund&#8221; in its title, can be treated as exempt since (amongst other things) it is prohibited from investing in equities, including UK equities.</p><p>Calculation and market value - there is guidance on calculating values for &#8216;N&#8217; and &#8216;E&#8217; (as required by paragraph 5 of Schedule 19) at <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM104060:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">STSM104060</remotelink> and <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM104070:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">STSM104070</remotelink>. This guidance should be followed, with fund managers needing to determine what is exempt (or not) at the date of any valuation used in that calculation. The method of determination of market value should be consistent across all Schedule 19 requirements. Fund managers do not necessarily need to re-evaluate the exempt status of an investment in an underlying scheme at every valuation point. They will need to judge how frequently to re-evaluate each investment depending on the quality of the evidence previously used and the likelihood of any change in the intervening period. Where an investment qualifies for the exemption by only a small margin then frequent re-evaluation may be necessary.</p><p>See <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM101010:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">STSM101010</remotelink> for the meaning of a collective investment scheme.</p><p>See <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM101020:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">STSM101020</remotelink> for the meaning of a unit trust.</p><p>See <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM101050:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">STSM101050</remotelink> for the meaning of an open-ended investment company.</p><p>See <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM105070:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">STSM105070</remotelink> and <remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM105080:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">STSM105080</remotelink> for further information on Exempt Investments - interests in other collective investment schemes.</p><p></p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM105050:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Previous page </remotelink></p></li><li><lilabel></lilabel><p><remotelink dpsi="0Y02" refpt="0Y02_STSM105070:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid"> Next page </remotelink></p></li></div><div contenteditable="true" class="container" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; float:right;"><h3>New version</h3><hr /><p></p><p>As outlined in <remotelink dpsi="0Y04" refpt="0Y04_STSM105050:MANUAL-PARA" remotekey1="REFPTID" service="DOC-ID" status="valid">STSM105050</remotelink>, an investment in a collective investment scheme is to be regarded as an exempt investment under FA86/S99(5B)(b) if, and only if, both:</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the underlying scheme is a collective investment scheme as defined in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000;</p></li><p>and</p><li><lilabel></lilabel><p>the value of the underlying scheme&#8217;s non-exempt investments is no more than 20 per cent of the value of its total investments.</p></li><h3>Practicalities</h3><p>Self-certification - fund managers will need to sign the notice confirming that their investments are either exempt or non-exempt for Schedule 19 purposes.
