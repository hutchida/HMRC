You must consider the economic reality not just the contractual terms.</p><sup>5</sup><p>The principal factor to consider is if a specific supply is made to the funder or a third party in return for a payment. If so then the payment is consideration for a supply, but if this direct link is not established then the payment can be treated as outside the scope of VAT.</p><sup>6</sup><p> Previous page</p><sup>7</sup><p> Next page</p></div></body></html>
