CG58027,CG58027 Amounts Brought Into Account By TCGA92/S48,"TCGA92/S138A (8) ensures that the rules on deferred ascertainable consideration apply in priority to those in TCGA92/S138A. It provides that any amount that would be included in the computations of a chargeable gain on a disposal by TCGA92/S48 cannot count as unascertainable consideration for the purposes of TCGA92/S138A. So, for example, consideration that could be within the definition of unascertainable in TCGA92/S138A (7) as described at CG58024 simply because it was contingent at the date of the disposal does not count as unascertainable consideration.",
CG58045,CG58045 Example,"In year 0 a taxpayer acquires all the shares in T Ltd for £100,000.",['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,In year 10 the taxpayer sells the shares in T Ltd at arm’s length to P Ltd.,['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,The consideration is ,['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,"cash £500,000, plus",['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,"80,000 shares in P Ltd at market value of £2.25 each (total £180,000), plus",['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,"the right to two payments of deferred consideration, the amount depending on future profits of T Ltd, to be satisfied only by an issue of shares in P Ltd.",['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,"The market value of the right to deferred consideration at the time of disposal is agreed by Shares and Assets Valuation at £300,000.",['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,"In year 11 shares in P Ltd to the value of £202,940 (73,000 shares at £2.78 each) are issued to the taxpayer in part satisfaction of the right to deferred consideration. The market value of the remainder of the right in year 11 is agreed by Shares and Assets Valuation at £90,000.",['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,"In year 12 shares in P Ltd to the value of £118,440 (47,000 shares at £2.52 each) are issued in full satisfaction of the remainder of the right to deferred consideration.",['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,P Ltd is a company whose shares are quoted on the Stock Exchange. All of the conditions are satisfied and the earn-out right is treated as a security by TCGA92/S138A.,['3149520']

CG58045,CG58045 Example,E) SHARES IN P LTD,['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,EXPLANATION,['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,The statutory reasons for the method of computation are;,['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,CASH RECEIVED,['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,The cash received is treated as a part-disposal of the old holding of T Ltd shares under TCGA92/S128 (3). The apportionment of the base cost of the old holding is made on the basis of market value at the date of disposal (TCGA92/S128 (4) and TCGA92/S129).,['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,COST OF SHARES IN P LTD,['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,The vendor has acquired shares in P Ltd and a `notional security’ under the terms of TCGA92/S138A. These are treated as two classes of shares. Together they form the `new holding’ under TCGA92/S127 as applied by TCGA92/S135 (3).,['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,If the shares in P Ltd are not quoted the apportionment should be made by reference to market values at the date of a disposal of all or part of the new holding.,['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,RIGHT TO DEFERRED UNASCERTAINABLE CONSIDERATION,['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,The part satisfaction of the right to deferred consideration is a part disposal of the right. But because of TCGA92/S138A it is treated as a conversion of securities within TCGA92/S132. TCGA92/S127 applies with the necessary adaptations to the part disposal and part of the base cost of the `notional security’ is transferred to the holding of shares in P Ltd.,['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,The procedure for obtaining valuations of the right to deferred unascertainable consideration is described at CG14950.,['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,SHARES IN P LTD,['3149520']
CG58045,CG58045 Example,The shares in P Ltd which are acquired go into the Section 104 holding of shares of the same class. The base cost and indexed pool of expenditure is calculated in accordance with B and C above.,['3149520']
